MIAMI QB COSTA IS HURRICANE TESTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI  (BC-FBC-MIAMI-COSTA-TEX)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a native of Philadelphia, the town of brotherly hate
where fans have booed Santa Claus, Mike Schmidt and Julius Erving,
Frank Costa should have been prepared.
</P>
<P>
He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
Costa is the senior quarterback for the University of Miami
(Fla.). That is the position of pedigree on a team that is famous
for national championships and winning quarterbacks. During the
past two seasons, Costa has struggled to measure himself against
the Hurricanes' Heroes.
</P>
<P>
He has been benched (last season), booed (last season), blasted
(by the media) and battered (by opponents' pass rushes). When Costa
leads the third-ranked Hurricanes against top-ranked Nebraska in
tonight's Orange Bowl, it will be his final chance to write his
legacy at Miami.
</P>
<P>
``If I play well, people will applaud me. If I play bad, I'll
get criticized,'' said the 6-foot-4, 215-pound Costa. ``I used to
let little things bother me -- like what people said about me. I've
gotten a lot more thick-skinned.
</P>
<P>
``In high school, I always got a lot of positive press and a lot
of fan support. I had never been booed or ripped apart until I came
down here. That's just part of being the quarterback down here.''
</P>
<P>
From Jim Kelly to Bernie Kosar to Vinnie Testaverde to Steve
Walsh to Craig Erickson to Gino Torretta, the Miami quarterback
torch has been passed. Along the way, there have been four national
championships and two Heisman Trophy winners (Testaverde and
Torretta).
</P>
<P>
``I'd love to be mentioned in the same breath with those guys,''
Costa said. ``If we beat Nebraska and I'm linked with those guys,
great. If they don't, that's fine. That's something I can't
control.''
</P>
<P>
When Costa's career ends tonight, his numbers will not match his
predecessors. If the Hurricanes defeat Nebraska and Penn State
loses to Oregon tomorrow in the Rose Bowl, Miami probably would
have another championship. But that scenario is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
But for Costa, his status as a starter in a game as important as
the Orange Bowl is a significant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
``He's come a long way,'' said Miami offensive coordinator Rich
Olson. ``With all the criticism he's had to go through, he's made
tremendous strides. He's had a great year. The last couple of days
in practice, he's thrown it about as well as since he's been
here.''
</P>
<P>
On Oct.9, 1993, Miami lost to eventual national champion Florida
State, and Costa lost his starting job to Ryan Collins. That loss --
a Costa interception was returned for a key touchdown -- became
Costa's crucible.
</P>
<P>
``I was very depressed after that game,'' he said. ``I used to
get up in the middle of the night and just drive around. I couldn't
eat, even though I tried. I lost 20 pounds in about three to four
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
His teammates realized that Costa was in a personal hell. They
tried to help him.
</P>
<P>
``I really can't imagine what he was going through,'' said
sophomore center K.C. Jones of Midland Lee High School. ``He's a
tough kid. He not only survived, but he thrived.''
</P>
<P>
But as he battled his demons and fought to regain his
confidence, Costa said, he began to see himself in a different
light.
</P>
<P>
``I grew up a lot after that game,'' he said. ``I went into that
game as a 21-year-old kid. I came out of it as a 21-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
Collins started the rest of the season and led the Hurricanes to
a 9-2 regular season. During Miami's 29-0 shellacking by Arizona in
the Fiesta Bowl, Costa played well in relief of Collins. Then,
after the game, Costa asked to meet with Miami coach Dennis
Erickson.
</P>
<P>
``I told him I felt like I got blamed for a lot of the stuff
that happened last season,'' Costa said. ``I asked him to look me
in the eye and tell me that I would have a fair chance to win the
job back during spring practice. I figured if I couldn't do that,
then I might transfer. When he said he would give me the chance,
that gave me a new life here.''
</P>
<P>
Costa reclaimed his job when he outplayed Collins during spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
Then came a 38-20 loss to Washington on Sept.24 that ended the
Hurricanes' NCAA-record 58-game home-field winning streak. The fans
and critics focused on a Costa interception that led to a touchdown
(the receiver slipped). With Florida State only two weeks away,
could Costa win a big game?
</P>
<P>
Against the Seminoles, Costa's numbers were not impressive. He
completed 18 of 32 passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns and two
interceptions. But the statistics were overshadowed by Miami's
34-20 victory that served as the starting point to the team's
eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
``He executed the game plan, made some great throws, and he
withstood their pressure,'' Olson said. ``The question was, could
he win the big game? For a quarterback, being able to win the big
game is what they live for. When he was able to win that game, that
was a great weight off his shoulders. His confidence, he's just a
different guy in practice.''
</P>
<P>
In the Hurricanes' final regular-season game against Boston
College, Costa was sacked six times and knocked down a dozen more.
A self-described pocket passer, Costa realizes that if he is going
to complete passes, he has to hold on to the ball until the last
minute. His toughness has earned his teammates' respect.
</P>
<P>
``He's taken an enormous number of shots,'' Jones said. ``There
have been some games I'm surprised he's been able to walk out of
the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
Costa was asked what advice he would give if asked by a high
school quarterback prospect who was considering playing at Miami.
</P>
<P>
``If he wants to prepare himself for the NFL and to get the most
out of himself as a quarterback, he should seriously consider
coming here,'' Costa said. ``If he wants to live the college life,
have a good time and start for three or four years, he shouldn't
come here. Most of our quarterbacks start for two years.
</P>
<P>
``There's nothing wrong with being a quarterback here. It
prepares you for anything. It prepares you for life.''

KIDD PASSING TEST WITH MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-BKN-MAVERICKS-KIDD-TEX)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason Kidd admits he belongs in calf-hugging tube socks, short
shorts and Chuck Taylor canvas high-tops.
</P>
<P>
In an NBA era dominated by 20-somethings obsessed with hanging
on the rim after their dunks, striking poses for their commercials
and comparing zeros in their bank accounts, the Mavericks' rookie
is a breath of fresh air for a rare, dying breed who appreciate the
lost art of passing the basketball.
</P>
<P>
``Some people say I'm a throwback,'' Kidd said. ``I don't know
about that. I just love to pass. I guess that appeals to the older
generation. Hopefully, I can do my part to make it vogue to pass
the ball at any age.''
</P>
<P>
Kidd's National Basketball Association career is only 25 games
old, but there's no hiding where it's heading. Following in the
footsteps and chest passes of legendary assist men Bob Cousy, Nate
Archibald, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson and John Stockton, Kidd
seems destined to re-establish the assist as an exciting,
marketable basketball play.
</P>
<P>
``People go to games just to watch Jason pass,'' Mavericks coach
Dick Motta said. ``It's been a long time since you heard that about
someone.''
</P>
<P>
Despite struggling with his shooting, Kidd has already proved
why the Mavericks paid $54 million for his services.
</P>
<P>
``He can control a game without scoring a single point,''
teammate Jamal Mashburn said. ``Players like that don't come around
very often.''
</P>
<P>
But for all his playmaking and productive energy, it's Kidd's
innate ability to propel a round ball from Point A to Point B with
precise efficiency and awe-inspiring flash that is drawing
attention from fans and praise from the game's all-time best
ballhandlers.
</P>
<P>
``He's got great instincts,'' said Utah's Stockton, who is on
pace to become the NBA's all-time assists leader in February. ``You
can see it in his eyes. He has a passion for passing. When he gets
the ball, everybody in the arena and his four teammates all perk
up. It's like they expect something great to happen.''
</P>
<P>
Since a spectacular opening night in which he energized a
victory against New Jersey with a smorgasbord of behind-the-back
and no-look assists, Kidd has excelled.
</P>
<P>
``I'm getting used to my teammates, and they're getting used to
me,'' said Kidd, 21, who occasionally bounces a pass off an
unsuspecting teammate's face. ``I'm not real concerned with my
stats, except that our record is better than most people
predicted.''
</P>
<P>
His 8.1 assists-per-game average is ninth in the league, a pace
that would challenge Derek Harper's team record single-season
assist mark of 637 but needs to improve if Kidd hopes to surpass
then-New York Knick Mark Jackson's rookie assist record of 868.
Kidd's contract, however, contains no assist incentives.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't have dared asked for bonuses for assists,'' said
Kidd, who has 202 assists and 79 turnovers. ``When I make an
assist, I'm just doing my job. That's why the Mavericks drafted
me.''
</P>
<P>
It's also why his idol, Johnson, speaks so highly of Kidd.
</P>
<P>
``He's impressive, fun to watch,'' said Johnson, the current
all-time assists leader with 9,921. ``What I like is that after one
of those plays where he jumps in the air, looks one way and goes
behind his back the other way to set up a dunk, he just busts his
butt back on defense. You've got to love his attitude. He's a
player.''
</P>
<P>
Kidd, accustomed to but still not comfortable with gushing
compliments, shies away from any comparisons to Hall of Famers such
as Johnson, Robertson and Cousy, who never shot above 39 percent in
any season but is considered one of the NBA's founding fathers of
assists after leading the league eight consecutive seasons from
1952 to '60.
</P>
<P>
``People can mention me in the same sentence with Magic and
Cousy because that would be proper English,'' Kidd joked. ``But
there's no comparison. I'm just a rookie learning the ropes.
Someday, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
Kidd said there's nothing magical about his play, explaining
that fast-break, no-look assists are a natural part of his pedigree
developed as the youngest, shortest player on the blacktop courts
in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
``When you're the 10th guy picked to play,'' Kidd said, ``you
pass the ball or you don't get picked again.''
</P>
<P>
Not all of Kidd's ability is natural. Sure, he has the physical
hand-eye coordination to thread the eye of a needle in a haystack,
but he also has a quick-thinking mind that appears to keep him one
step ahead of the other nine players on the court.
</P>
<P>
Consider the mental checklist Kidd goes through upon grabbing a
rebound, making a steal or receiving an outlet pass en route to an
assist:
</P>
<P>
``First I have to identify where the other players are and
figure out where they're going to be in the next couple of seconds.
Knowing the personnel is half of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
``After looking for a long pass possibility, I determine by
personnel and pure numbers whether to push the ball or not. A lot
goes into that, like realizing who is on my left, on my right, who
is back on defense and what the game situation is.''
</P>
<P>
``If I decide to break, I've then got to decide what's the best
setup. Is it to give it to Jamal on the left against a good
defender with four fouls, to Jimmy (Jackson) on the right against a
poor defender with one foul or to take it to the hole myself?''
</P>
<P>
``That's the hard part. Once I decide what to do, though
sometimes that's not until I'm in the air, that's when I've then
got to determine which type of pass to use -- chest, bounce,
no-look, behind-the-back or invent something new. At that time it's
a matter of executing a pass I've thrown thousands of times.''
</P>
<P>
If it sounds complicated, remember that Kidd produces those
decisions and actions in about the same amount of time it takes to
read this sentence.
</P>
<P>
``Behind every great pass, there is usually a great risk,'' said
Motta, who said former Chicago center Tom Boerwinkle is the best
pure passer he has coached before Kidd. ``Jason makes great passes,
but he usually doesn't take great risks. Some of his best passes
aren't flashy at all. But he simply loves to pass. He probably
spends nine-tenths of his practice time working on passing and
ballhandling. That's a trait a coach can't instill.''
</P>
<P>
But it's one Motta and other throwbacks can certainly
appreciate.

DOLPHINS, MARINO OUTDUEL CHIEFS AND MONTANA 27-17
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI  (BC-FBN-DOLPHINS-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year's final evening might have been HIS exit as
well. For now, Joe Montana has been retired.
</P>
<P>
He'll have the rest of the Super Bowl tournament to start
racking up contemplations.
</P>
<P>
The surest way to see Montana live in '95 was denied by Dan
Marino and the Miami Dolphins, who get the January playoff game.
Football's pass-throwing deity and the rest of the Kansas City
Chiefs were crunched by Marino's gaudy numbers Saturday, falling
27-17 in an AFC wild-card shootout at Joe Robbie Stadium that some
suspect was Montana's last.
</P>
<P>
``Ain't even thinking about that right now,'' said Montana, the
38-year-old living legend who, until this moment, had overshadowed
the statistically superior Marino with four San Francisco
championship rings. ``I didn't think I had to think about it.
</P>
<P>
``It's like asking a fighter after he's lost a championship bout
if he'll fight again. You feel bad, but, yeah, the game's fun. I'm
having fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
It had been a decade since Montana and Marino last dueled, and
both quarterbacks appeared intent on clarifying how grand a shame
that is. Throwing to a standard befitting Super Bowl qualifiers --
as they were in 1984, when Montana's 49ers took the title in a
38-16 rout of Marino's Dolphins -- each had a perfect game going at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
The fun factor then began to dissipate for the Chiefs, who
earned this first-round appearance minus Montana for part of the
fourth quarter in last week's one-sided victory over the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
Saturday with its cult figure, Kansas City (9-8) figured to have
a comeback shot in this fourth quarter after Marino, long maligned
for little success in the big games, guided the Dolphins to a
touchdown just before the break and again to start the third.
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's old reliables faltered at the end, though, with
Montana intercepted by J.B. Brown at the Dolphins' goal line with
11:28 left and Marcus Allen fumbling on the Chiefs' next
possession.
</P>
<P>
Miami advances to Sunday's divisional round at San Diego,
champion of the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' said Allen, who picked up 10
of his 64 yards on the fateful carry before strong safety Michael
Stewart yanked the ball out of the ex-Raiders back's hands. ``What
we thought at the beginning of the season didn't happen. There's no
rhyme or reason. It didn't happen. That's life, and you keep
playing.''
</P>
<P>
We'll see about Montana, who, if still bothered by that
Raiders-inflicted knee injury, hides pain well. He opened with
seven straight completions, moved the Chiefs to all 17 points in
their first three drives, was 12 of 15 passing for 178 yards in two
quarters and finished 26 of 37 for 314 yards and those two early
scoring throws.
</P>
<P>
Marino's glowing, intercept-free line -- 22 of 29 for 257 yards
and two touchdowns -- was just supported by a better defense, as the
Dolphins beat Kansas City a second time to go with a 45-28 victory
here Dec. 12 with Steve Bono in for Montana.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know whether he's lost anything or not,'' Dolphins
linebacker Bryan Cox said of Montana. ``Everybody wants to make a
god out of him. I'm not looking to make a god out of anybody. He's
had a great career, he's a future Hall of Famer, but I can't be
concerned with that.''
</P>
<P>
Marino added, ``There were no scores to be settled.'' Asked to
share his post-game conversation with Montana, Marino replied:
``There were too many people around. I just wished him good luck.''
</P>
<P>
Montana might have used up his good fortune in the first half.
From the first series, he was flawless, displaying a touch that
came through clearest on a looping, just-before-the-contact
connection with Allen for 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
On the opening drive, Montana was 6 of 6, capped by a 1-yard
toss to Derrick Walker after just 6:28. After the Dolphins
retaliated -- Bernie Parmalee's 1-yard run made it 7-7 -- Montana
needed just four plays for another score.
</P>
<P>
To that point, he was 9 of 10, the only errant pass being an
underhand shovel under pressure from Cox. On the next play, Cox
ended up helping the Chiefs, propelling Kimble Anders down a
wide-open sideline by failing to hold on after the hit on Anders'
catch of a screen.
</P>
<P>
The first hint of Montana's mortality came at the Miami 3 on
third down with the Dolphins within 14-10. Looking for Eric Martin,
Montana sailed the pass behind him, and settling for a field goal
gave Marino an opening to tie it before the half closed.
</P>
<P>
Marino did (a 13-play, 80-yard march ending on a 1-yard pass to
Ronnie Williams), and again to open the third. Unruffled by James
Saxon's drop of an uncontested pass from Kansas City's 7, Marino
found Irving Fryar for a touchdown on the next play for 24-17.
</P>
<P>
When the Chiefs punted away on a fourth-and-1 from Miami's 47
halfway through the third, Marino responded by taking the Dolphins
to points anyway, Pete Stoyanovich's 40-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
``My feeling on that, I don't want to give them (such good field
position) in a seven-point game,'' Kansas City coach Marty
Schottenheimer said. ``That QB is too good. You have to make them
play on a longer field.
</P>
<P>
``In the final analysis, you give them 27 points and that's a
handful to overcome. The quarterback is extraordinary. He hasn't
achieved everything he's achieved with mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
Marino certainly didn't need any help, but willingly took it on
the field-goal drive when the Chiefs tacked on a face-mask penalty
to the first playoff reception for UCLA alum Scott Miller, moving
the ball to Kansas City's 28.
</P>
<P>
``Look, we had our chances,'' said Chiefs cornerback Mark
Collins, the former Cal State Fullerton standout who victimized the
Raiders with an interception for a touchdown just seven days prior.
``We didn't do it. That's the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
``The other guy had a great game, and that was basically it.''
</P>
<P>
For the Chiefs' season, yes. For their quarterback ...
</P>
<P>
``I assure you,'' Schottenheimer said, ``I didn't broach the
topic.''

The listings are based on computer-processed sales figures from
3,050 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than
38,000 retail outlets, including newsstands, variety stores,
supermarkets, and bookstores. These figures are statistically
adjusted to represent sales in all such outlets across the United
States. The number of titles within the two subdivisions of
non-fiction can change from week to week, reflecting changes in
book buying.

LIVE FROM THE BATTLEFIELD. From Vietnam to Baghdad: 35 Years in
the World's War Zones

	By Peter Arnett. Touchstone/Simon  Schuster, $14.

	A reporter who has covered conflicts all over the globe, most
recently the gulf war, describes the dangerous work that has earned
him many distinguished prizes, but also the criticism of senators
and Presidents. His memoir is ``lean and clear ... rich in
anecdote, redolent in its description,'' Bill Keller said here last
year.

	THE SILENT CRY

	By Kenzaburo Oe. Translated by John Bester. Kodansha
International, $11.

	This 1967 novel by last year's winner of the Nobel Prize in
Literature concerns two brothers who have come back to their
ancestral village in western Japan. One turns inward, contemplating
personal crises; the other tries to mobilize the local youth
against a predatory Korean merchant. Writing in The New York Times
last year, Sarah Lyall called the book ``among Mr. Oe's most famous
works.'' Grove has also reissued new paperback editions of two
works of fiction by Oe, both translated by John Nathan, and an
anthology he edited. A PERSONAL MATTER ($7.95) draws on the
author's own experiences as the father of a handicapped child. The
protagonist, called Bird, cannot accept the birth of his
brain-damaged son, and withdraws into thoughts of escape and
infanticide before accepting responsibility for the frail baby.
``It owes obvious debts to Kierkegaard: the search for -- and
confrontation with -- the self,'' James Toback said here in 1968.
TEACH US TO OUTGROW OUR MADNESS ($11) consists of four short novels
that explore themes ranging from mental and physical illness to
Japanese-American relations. THE CRAZY IRIS: And Other Stories of
the Atomic Aftermath ($11), edited by Oe, includes work by various
writers and translators. Most of the authors were victims of the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and their fiction captures
their history and that of their country. In 1985, our reviewer,
Fumiko Mori Halloran, said they ``seem to have reached the same
conclusion -- the best way to express their feelings was to restrain
emotions and concentrate on facts.''

	AT THE HAND OF MAN: Peril and Hope for Africa's Wildlife

	By Raymond Bonner. Vintage, $12.

	The author concentrates on the African elephant, a species that
can be as destructive to its environment as man is to his. He
argues that culling the herds is necessary to preserve them -- a
view many animal rights proponents oppose. The book's ``greatest
value ... is that it shows how complex the realities of
conservation really are,'' Ian Tattersall said here in 1993.

	THE PALACE THIEF

	By Ethan Canin. Picador USA, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y.
10010, $10.

	These four long fictions illuminate the lives of men who are
trying to make their way in a world that has passed them by,
largely because of their own failings. Last year, our reviewer,
Abby Frucht, praised ``Mr. Canin's habit of tightening a
character's grip on ordinary, dependable objects, only to allow
those objects to detonate in a vast psychological minefield.''

	DEN OF LIONS: Memoirs of Seven Years

	By Terry Anderson. Ballantine, $5.99.

	The author recalls both his ordeal as a hostage of Islamic
fundamentalists in Beirut and his relationship with the Lebanese
woman, now his wife, who gave birth to their daughter while he was
captive. ``Beyond its compelling reportage,'' the book is ``an
improbable and moving love story,'' Eugene Kennedy said here in
1993.

	DOGS OF GOD

	By Pinckney Benedict. Plume, $10.95.

	The scene is the West Virginia mountains, where an amoral drug
lord named Tannhauser rules over an abandoned military post until
he is challenged by an idealistic boxer. Last year, our reviewer,
Marilyn Stasio, said the author writes ``with the lyrical
exactitude of Henry Thoreau on a metaphysical field trip to hell.''

	MORE HOME COOKING: A Writer Returns to the Kitchen

	By Laurie Colwin. Harper Perennial, $12.

	This posthumously published collection includes more of the
author's tributes to food and its pleasures, whether it is fresh
biscuits, free-range eggs, or a chocolate cake from childhood.
``Read as they were meant to be, Laurie Colwin's food thoughts are
like phone calls from a dear friend,'' Laura Shapiro said here in
1993.

	PALAIS-ROYAL

	By Richard Sennett. Norton, $11.95.

	Two brothers, one an architect and the other a priest,
illustrate different sides of the Romantic imagination in this
novel, which takes place in mid-19th-century Paris and London and
features cameos by the likes of Balzac and George Sand. In 1987,
our reviewer, Richard Holmes, called it ``exhilarating and amusing
to read.''

	SONGBIRDS, TRUFFLES, AND WOLVES: An American Naturalist in Italy

	By Gary Paul Nabhan. Penguin, $10.95.

	The author, an ethnobotanist, trekked 200 miles across the
Italian heartland in 1990 for both professional and personal
reasons: to study the world embraced by St. Francis and to seek
solace from a messy divorce. The result is ``as satisfying as a
shot of grappa with a plate of anisette cookies,'' Peter Bernhardt
said here in 1993. More reflections on nature are to be found in
two books by Roger B. Swain, both reissued, with new introductions,
by Lyons  Burford. FIELD DAYS: Journal of an Itinerant Biologist
($12.95) explores everything from ``hamburgers and houseplants'' to
``sophisticated fly-paper.'' In 1984, our reviewer, Linda Yang,
called it ``subtle and positively sparkling.'' EARTHLY PLEASURES:
Tales From a Biologist's Garden ($12.95) celebrates the cultivation
of human relationships as well as the planting and preparing of
vegetables. In 1981 our reviewer, Ken Emerson, said the author ``is
able, like most good essayists, to think big thoughts and small
thoughts at the same time.''

`EAKINS AND THE PHOTOGRAPH'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-DANLEY-BOOK-REVIEW-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hailed by many critics as the greatest American artist of the
19th century, Thomas Eakins has long been an almost mythical
character. His blend of meticulously detailed realism and
psychological insight has been proclaimed a particularly American
style of painting; the story of his dismissal from his teaching
position in 1886 for removing the loincloth from a male model
before a female drawing class has been endlessly recounted as an
example of the modern artist's commitment to visual truth in the
face of provincial prudery.
</P>
<P>
But as often happens, the legend of Eakins has obscured the
complexities of his work and life. Instead of seeing him simply as
a Modernist hero, recent scholars have tended to regard him as a
figure whose checkered career, with its early successes and later
disappointments, raises a host of questions about what it meant to
be an artist in late 19th-century America.
</P>
<P>
A central topic in this reconsideration of Eakins is his long
involvement with photography. ``Eakins and the Photograph,'' a
catalogue of images by the artist, his family and students taken
from the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts,
offers a somewhat specialized look at an important and problematic
aspect of his career.
</P>
<P>
Eakins took up photography around 1880, and over the next two
decades made extensive use of the medium. Not only did he take
photographs as sketches for some of his most famous paintings, from
``The Pathetic Song'' (1881) to ``The Swimming Hole'' (circa 1883),
but he also created nude studies for his classes at the
Pennsylvania Academy, where he taught from 1876 to 1886.
</P>
<P>
Many artists of the day welcomed photography as an aid to
drawing, but Eakins appears to have taken it more seriously. He
often enlarged his pictures, then a difficult operation, and
printed them with the demanding platinum process.
</P>
<P>
Eakins's platinum prints, some of which are included in a small
show of his paintings and photographs now at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, are replete with sharp detail and delicate tones.
But they also have a shimmering, hazy quality out of keeping with
the precise, clearly delineated style for which he is renowned.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pictures in the academy's collection are portraits
and show the attention to nuances of expression that characterizes
his paintings of individuals.
</P>
<P>
A few are landscapes and studies of such genre subjects as shad
fishing in Gloucester, N.J. Others are examples of the motion
studies that he carried out in 1884-85 alongside Eadweard
Muybridge, the photographer whose pioneering studies of people and
animals in motion are often credited with leading to the invention
of the motion picture.
</P>
<P>
But the largest group of photographs consists of nude studies, a
fact that at first seems curious, given that Eakins rarely included
nudes in his paintings. The essayists in ``Eakins and the
Photograph'' spend much of their time trying to figure out what
these pictures meant to Eakins, and to place them in the context of
the time.
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing, and convincing, analysis of Eakins's use of
the nude in his photographs is offered by Elizabeth Johns, a
professor of art history at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Professor Johns suggests that Eakins's practice of having
students pose nude for him and for one another, and of himself
posing without clothes for photographs, was not, as he claimed,
simply a way to further the study of anatomy that he believed was
central to an artist's education.
</P>
<P>
Nor was it just the product of repressed sensuality and latent
exhibitionism on Eakins's part, though he was involved in enough
incidents that echo the loincloth episode to make clear that, at
the least, he had a predilection for courting scandal.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Professor Johns suggests, such practices reinforced a
sense of artistic community among Eakins and his pupils and
strengthened the idea that artists were outside the moral
constraints of conventional society.
</P>
<P>
Eakins may also have been looking back to his days as a student
in Paris, where, as Anne McCauley writes in her essay, academic
photographic studies of nudes for artists were a tradition. Or he
may have been looking even further back, to an Arcadian past
exemplified by classical Greek sculpture, or to a sylvan paradise;
in a notable series taken outdoors, he photographed himself and his
wife nude with a horse. But in a time when images, and particularly
photographs, with even the slightest hint of sexual content were
widely condemned, Eakins's unorthodox behavior was bound to draw
censure.
</P>
<P>
As Mary Panzer makes clear in her contribution to the book,
Eakins had a genuine interest in anatomy and the engineering of the
body: the course of instruction he set up at the academy included
dissecting cadavers, and in 1894 he addressed the Academy of
Natural Sciences in Philadelphia on ``The Differential Action of
Certain Muscles Passing More Than One Joint,'' illustrating the
talk with his own photographs of the functions of a severed horse
leg.
</P>
<P>
Given the current interest in artists' personal lives, it is
tempting to psychologize about Eakins's behavior. But to regard him
and his art simply as the sum of his neuroses or compulsions, real
or rumored, overlooks important issues about his work.
</P>
<P>
What was the relationship of his photography to the careful
method he followed in his painting, which was based on extensive
analysis and research into his subjects? How exactly did he regard
his photographs, particularly the nudes?
</P>
<P>
``Eakins and the Photograph'' offers no definitive answers to
these and other questions, but it raises them in ways that are both
provocative and insightful.

FRANNY CRADOCK, BRITISH TELEVISION COOKING TEACHER, DIES AT 85
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-CRADOCK-OBIT-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fanny Cradock, who won a niche in British social history by
teaching luxury-starved Britons to cook better after the austere
years of World War II, died on Dec. 27 in a nursing home in East
Sussex, England. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Cradock, garbed in gems and evening gowns, enlightened
television viewers with hundreds of how-to-cook programs, which
began in the early 1950s and were influential in Britain for years.
Her television career lasted until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The programs also featured her amiable kitchen partner,
companion and, eventually, husband, Maj. John Cradock, an alumnus
of Harrow who sported a monocle and a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Cradocks wrote columns for British newspapers.
Her writings included ``The Practical Cook'' (1949) and ``The
Ambitious Cook'' (1950), and she also wrote books jointly with the
major.
</P>
<P>
``The Cradocks' secret was the snobbery and pretension of the
times,'' the British newspaper The Independent recalled on
Thursday. ``In the postwar era they made their hungry, servantless
readers and viewers feel they still belonged to an elite.''
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Cradock was also known for such comments as, ``The British
housewife's greatest handicap is the British husband -- who just
wants what mum used to make.'' In 1956 she got into a dispute with
Raymond Oliver, a chef appearing on French television, when he
suggested that men were better cooks than women.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Cradock, originally named Phyllis Primrose-Pechey, learned
about cooking as a girl, from hotel cooks and her grandmother. Her
father went bankrupt and she was a vacuum-cleaner seller,
dressmaker, newspaperwoman and novelist.
</P>
<P>
The major died in 1987. She is survived by two sons.

SHRIMPLAND INHERITING ORANGE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI  (BC-FBC-VECSEY-COLUMN-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're shifting the game called the Orange Bowl to the
land of the shrimp-eaters. In 1997, the Orange Bowl game will be
played in the swanky confines of Joe Robbie Stadium, where the
wealthiest fans can ingest crustaceans behind air-conditioned glass
and use private plumbing without having to mix with those sweaty
people out there in the stands.
</P>
<P>
This is the future of sports. America's going soft. The children
are playing video games instead of hide-and-seek or
catch-a-fly-is-up. We might as well get used to it. Much of the
upwardly mobile mischief committed by our benefactors who run
big-time sports is done in the name of luxury boxes, the
money-producing inner sanctums.
</P>
<P>
Now it's even happening to the venerable madness of the Orange
Bowl game. The officials should have moved the game next year
rather than wait until 1997. It's not going to be the same without
the old joint being the center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
Bizarre, compelling things have happened very late at night in
the New Year's game, very often affecting the national title of
college football. That legacy continued Sunday night. If Nebraska
happened to beat Miami, Nebraska would be undefeated and probably
maintain its edge over Penn State in the polls. But if Miami
happened to beat Nebraska, that would leave it up to Penn State to
beat Oregon in the Rose Bowl this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sure Joe Paterno is out there thinking this is out of his
hands,'' said Tom Osborne, the Nebraska coach. ``I don't get caught
up in it. I just hope we play well. I'd love to win a national
championship, but it depends on the ballot box. The luck of the
draw, when you play 'em, where you play 'em.''
</P>
<P>
This is nothing new for Penn State, which claims to have been
jobbed out of three national titles by the anarchic system of
polls.
</P>
<P>
But come to think of it, who told Penn State to join the Big
Ten, casting its fate with schools stretching all the way out to
Iowa? Who told Penn State to join a conference that is committed to
playing in the Rose Bowl into the next century? That's Penn State's
problem.
</P>
<P>
And it will be the Big Ten's problem again next year, when the
new coalition takes over, rotating the two top available teams
among the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar bowls. That means that only once
every three years can the Orange Bowl affect the national title.
That's kind of too bad, because the Orange Bowl has been the hot
bowl of the 80s and 90s, making the Cotton Bowl totally obsolete
and the Rose Bowl usually irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
Who will forget Miami edging Nebraska, 31-30, for the 1983
title? Certainly not Osborne, the Jimmy Stewart look-alike who
bravely went for a 2-point conversion. Osborne walked into the
Orange Bowl last week and admitted he had ``mixed feelings'' about
the place, and he added, ``I'm not necessarily sad to see it go.''
</P>
<P>
He's also lost Orange Bowls to Oklahoma, Clemson and Florida
State in this house of horrors.
</P>
<P>
But then again, Notre Dame had a touchdown called back for a
penalty against Colorado for the 1990 title and Oklahoma was
bushwhacked by Miami for the 1987 national title. And the Miami
players have come to identify the crumbling palace as their extra
weapon even though their 58-game undefeated streak was ended by
Washington in September.
</P>
<P>
``It's our home,'' said K.C. Jones, the Miami center. ``It makes
us real confident. At night, there's something different. People
have been partying all day, most of them are intoxicated, and they
let it loose on the other team. I wish we could play at night all
the time here.''
</P>
<P>
He loves the crowd, that unique Cuban, Jewish, African-American,
Southern, glad-to-get-away-from-road-salt-and-overcoats,
northern-capital-of-Latin America crowd that converges on the
Orange Bowl on select occasions.
</P>
<P>
``It's not really a melting pot, but it's a tossed salad, the
epitome of South Florida,'' Jones said with great affection.
</P>
<P>
Jones has enjoyed standing on the sidelines watching visiting
quarterbacks trying to change signals while the great majority of
78,000 fans screamed their south Florida lungs out.
</P>
<P>
In two years, a big chunk of the Orange Bowl crowd will be
behind insulated, tinted glass -- unseen, unheard, but wolfing down
those shrimp and that cocktail sauce. With video games for the
kids, no doubt.

`IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BUDDHA'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the romance has gone out of travel, blame television and all
those old movie travelogues. The urge to go trekking to far-off
places can be considerably diminished by films that, even if
sketchy, give the armchair tourist a fairly good idea of what it's
like being there, but without the burdens of luggage and surly
waiters. The better the television documentary, it seems to me, the
worse for travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Among the best of those television excursions is the current PBS
series ``Legendary Trails'' (an inadequate title that suggests dull
hikes through dreary woods). The four programs, produced by the BBC
and each narrated by an expert author or journalist, travel to
places considered sacred by pilgrims of various religious stripes.
</P>
<P>
As George Page, executive producer for Channel 13, observes,
``You don't have to believe in anything particularly religious or
spiritual to be awed by the variety and difficulty of the journey
people have made for the sake of their souls.''
</P>
<P>
The series began by following the ancient frankincense trade
route from Oman to Jerusalem, retraced by the broadcaster Emma
Freud, a great-granddaughter of Sigmund.
</P>
<P>
Then Nicholas Shakespeare, a novelist and critic, joined 60,000
pilgrims atop a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, where Jesus is said
to have appeared to a young goatherder 200 years ago. Shakespeare's
theatrics, replete with unsubstantiated claims, were the weak point
of the series.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Alexander Frater, the chief travel correspondent
for The Observer in London, follows ``In the Footsteps of Buddha,''
beginning in Katmandu, Nepal, now a refuge for thousands of
Tibetans fleeing China, and moving through Hindu India to reach
Bodh Gaya, Buddhism's most sacred shrine. Explaining that Buddhism
urges followers to be ``not too hard on yourself, but not too
indulgent, either,'' Frater travels through a land of stunning
contradictions, finding at one point gentle monks protecting a
little boy thought to be the reincarnation of a venerated monk, at
another a nearly deserted town overrun by crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
There are some almost surreal moments. Frater comes across
another Buddha in the form of Keanu Reeves when he runs into the
cast and crew of the Bernardo Bertolucci film ``Little Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
Frater makes a quick exit from the ornate set, noting ``I must
leave this palace of illusions.'' In the end, he concludes that
India offers a new dimension that ``can fill your mind, even your
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
Next week, the series ends with the novelist David Lodge on
``The Way of St. James,'' or El Camino de Santiago, the 1,000-mile
pilgrimage route from Le Puy in France to Santiago in northern
Spain. Technically, to receive a compostela, or official
verification, the journey is supposed to be made on foot. But Lodge
confesses, ``The constraints of time and television compelled me to
cheat a little on my pilgrimage.'' He adds, ``In fact, I cheated
quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
Although High Mass in Santiago is somewhat disappointing for
Lodge (``The sermon didn't set the pews alive''), he finds solace
in pondering the long, tangled history of the pilgrimage: ``a
mixture of piety, superstition, commercial exploitation,
nationalistic sentiment and superb art, all inspired by a legend
with no historical foundation whatsoever, yet capable of exerting
its magnetism even in our skeptical modern age.''
</P>
<P>
Add stunning photography, and ``Legendary Trails'' is almost
enough to make every viewer sign up for the next pilgrimage package
tour. Almost. As for this hopelessly lazy traveler, it's not likely
I'll end up reading any pilgrimage guide book. I saw the movie.

PASADENA, Calif.  (BC-FBC-ROSE-BOWL-500ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Penn State is a day late and perhaps a
ranking short. If the stars align, or if Miami were to defeat
Nebraska Sunday night, the No. 2 Nittany Lions can win an
undisputed national championship. Otherwise, a salute to the Rose
Bowl queen will have to do.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Rose Bowl will be either anticlimactic or climactic,
depending on the score in a far-off stadium. At times in Joe
Paterno's 68 years, he has seen something like it, so he is not
scheduling his New Year's Day dinner around the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
``I like Tom Osborne,'' Paterno said of top-ranked Nebraska's
head coach. ``But I suppose, in the clutch, I'll be rooting for
Miami. Because of our kids, of course. We'll watch it the way we
always do. It's the night before our game, and if the ball game's
on, we'll watch it. If they want to go to bed, go to bed. I've
never been one to worry about things I can't do anything about.''
</P>
<P>
If Miami were to prevail over Nebraska and Penn State gores
Oregon in the Rose Bowl, then the 11-0 Nittany Lions will carry
Paterno from the field and own their first national title since
1986. If Miami takes Nebraska and Oregon shocks Penn State, then
Paterno will have a headache and the Hurricanes will own the title.
But if Nebraska and Penn State are both victorious, then it comes
down to a poll.
</P>
<P>
``If so, I may call my Italian friends to see how many votes
we've got,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
At Paterno's age, he would prefer to just smell the roses, and,
so, he is obviously at the right place. He is simply happy to be
here, Oregon will second that emotion, and may the least distracted
team win.
</P>
<P>
Penn State has perhaps the nation's best running back (Ki-Jana
Carter), best wide receiver (Bobby Engram) and best quarterback
(Kerry Collins), and 9-3 Oregon acts as if it is shaking in its
collective cleats.
</P>
<P>
``I'd get Kerry Collins to sign my program if I could,'' Ducks
tight end Josh Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
``Listen,'' said Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, ``Penn State is one
of the top two or three teams that has ever played college
football. Collins is bigger than any our of linebackers. He hasn't
been sacked a lot because people don't even get close.''
</P>
<P>
But Oregon has an idea: the blitz. It has been the team's
recurring theme all season to send their linebackers at all cost
and pray for their talented secondary. All-American cornerback
Herman O'Berry could be most valuable player, or toast.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of skeptics think we'll screw it up somehow,'' Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
Sights and sounds may be deceiving, but the Ducks appear to be
the looser group. Paterno has been frightened ever since Carter and
Collins took off on a post-season banquet tour -- posing with Bob
Hope, for instance -- and his worst nightmare is that they will show
rust.
</P>
<P>
Carter, after his initial practice here, complained of sore
legs, and that is all it took to get Paterno cracking the whip. His
practices have been closed and, he said, mediocre.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Brooks, on the other hand, has described his practices as
charming, and the workouts have been open to any passerby able to
climb through the fence.
</P>
<P>
These are obviously, then, two teams passing in the night. Penn
State players are not allowed to wear earrings; some Oregon players
wear three at a time. Penn State players have been careful not to
critique Oregon or upset them; Oregon has gone on record rooting
for Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
``I love Nebraska,'' Wilcox said. ``Nebraska's my favorite team.
If I'd gotten a recruiting letter from them, I'd have probably
framed it.''
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three years, the Rose Bowl is in breathing
distance of a national championship game, and all of the 103,000
tickets have been swallowed whole. And, in reflection this week,
Paterno has turned sentimental.
</P>
<P>
``Listen, this is the first Rose Bowl Penn State's ever been in,
for all intent and purposes,'' the coach said, alluding to a 1923
loss to Southern Cal. ``So, there shouldn't be one negative thing
about this trip. If we win this football game, this will be one of
the greatest seasons Penn State's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
It would certainly be better than 1969, when the Nittany Lions
went 11-0 and still lost out to Texas in the polls. That year,
President Nixon even presented the Longhorns with a No. 1 plaque --
late in the season -- and Paterno could not help bringing that up
this week.
</P>
<P>
``One of my most annoying moments,'' he called it. On the other
hand, if the stars do not align tonight, if Nebraska does beat
Miami, Paterno expects the president to side with him this time.
</P>
<P>
``Because Hillary's father, Hugh, played for Penn State,'' he
said. ``You can look it up.''
</P>
<P>
In 1934, to be exact.

THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE WHO WILL MAKE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-MUSIC-CONTRACTORS-814(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an orchestra performs, listeners reflexively
allocate credit and blame to the conductor and the players. But in
the freelance ensembles that account for most of New York City's
musical life there is another significant but generally unnoticed
force at work. Although the players produce the sounds and the
conductors shape them, it is the orchestral contractor who decides
which musicians the conductor will face.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera
Orchestra, which have permanent rosters and year-round contracts,
ensembles like the New York Chamber Symphony, the Brooklyn
Philharmonic, the American Symphony Orchestra and the Mostly Mozart
Orchestra are assembled from a pool of more than 1,000 freelance
musicians who work in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
Putting these ensembles together requires not only a sense of
the players' strengths and weaknesses, but a feeling for the
chemistry among them. When contractors discuss performances they
have arranged, they tend to speak in terms of authorial pride about
the ones that went particularly well, or with uncertainty about the
ones in which last-minute changes left them biting their nails.
</P>
<P>
``We're about to play Bruckner works for brass and choir,'' said
Ronald Sell, a hornist who has been the contractor for the American
Symphony Orchestra since 1980, when he was elected to the position
by the orchestra's musicians. ``Suddenly, there's talk of recording
the pieces the day after the performance, and I'm trying to find
out if all the players are available. I don't want one group
playing the concert and another making the record. Generally,
musicians like to record and make themselves available, but I'm not
sure yet how this will work out.''
</P>
<P>
There are more than a dozen major contractors on the classical
music side of the business in New York, each juggling symphonic,
chamber music and sometimes choral accounts. Some also contract for
theater productions and jingle recordings.
</P>
<P>
The job evolved decades ago as a matter of practical necessity:
entrepreneurs who wanted to present concerts realized that the most
efficient way to hire an ensemble was first to hire a musician with
good contacts.
</P>
<P>
At the moment the contracting business is in flux. After
freelance musicians went on strike last January, the biggest
freelance orchestras agreed to establish core rosters. Contractors
must call those players first, which means that their control has
diminished considerably.
</P>
<P>
Market pressures have also taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
``In the last two years, organizations have cut back on the
number of performances they are presenting,'' said Glickman, a
bassoonist who began contracting in 1952 and now runs Lydian
Productions, the biggest symphonic contracting concern in New York.
``Some have cut back by 20 or 30 percent. That hurts, and if it
hurts me it hurts the players much more.''
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the field is expanding, and as younger players get
into the contracting business, they are challenging established
alignments. Last season, for example, Neil Balm, a trumpeter, and
Jonathan Haas, a percussionist, formed Gemini Music Productions.
</P>
<P>
Both highly regarded players, they cut their contracting teeth
on independent projects like a concert of Frank Zappa's orchestral
music at Lincoln Center two seasons ago. Now they have their first
major account, the New York Pops, an orchestra that Glickman
contracted until now.
</P>
<P>
``Actually, our main business is putting together projects and
selling them to various halls and series,'' Balm explained.
``Contracting fell into our lap, but since we're both active
performers and we know the musicians in New York, we decided that
it was something we should do.''
</P>
<P>
The job is streamlined these days, thanks in part to computers.
Usually, contractors and conductors meet well before a performance
to discuss how many players are needed, how many rehearsals and
concerts are involved and whether the music poses any special
challenges. Once the details are seen to, the contractor calculates
the costs and usually demands that the musicians' salaries be put
in an escrow account.
</P>
<P>
The next step is working the phones. Balm has about 150
musicians listed in his little black book. Sell has about the same
number. Glickman, the contractor for the New York Chamber Symphony,
the Mostly Mozart Orchestra and the Little Orchestra Society as
well as several choruses, said that his roster includes 400
musicians and that he knows how they all play.
</P>
<P>
``I also know their idiosyncrasies,'' Glickman said. ``I know
who will absolutely not sit in a second violin section, and who
won't share a stand with so and so. I don't write these things
down, but I seem to remember them. I have to be very conscious of
how an orchestra is made up, because I want my orchestras to sound
good and I don't want any fights.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
But contractors inherit fights anyway. Relations with the
musicians union, for example, have become increasingly complicated.
Because virtually all contractors also perform, they are members of
the union and are taken into account in the union's fee schedule,
which provides for payment at double the normal scale (although
some prefer to earn a percentage of ticket sales). Yet the union
regards them with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
``It's a gray area,'' said Bill Moriarty, the president of Local
802 of the American Federation of Musicians. ``In their capacity as
players, we protect them. But when they do their duties as
contractors, we view them as management representatives. I have to
say, they don't have an easy job. They have to call the players,
make sure everyone shows up, do the payrolls and see that the
musicians get their checks. But before the 1993 contract brought
job security to the freelance field, players were subject to
contractors' whims, or to changes that might occur if an orchestra
changed contractors.''
</P>
<P>
Contractors, not surprisingly, take a different view. Mr. Sell,
of the American Symphony, is one of several contractors critical of
the 1993 contract.
</P>
<P>
``The union pretty much wiped out the freelance field with that
contract,'' Sell said. ``When you establish a roster, it's no
longer a freelance orchestra, at least not entirely. There is some
leeway. If core players are not available I can call a substitute,
and since our core is about 60 players, I can call on another 20 or
30 to fill out the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
``But it means that for a great new violinist or trumpet player,
the opportunities are fewer. Freelancing used to be a way for new
players to be heard, to get a foot in the door. That can still
happen, but it's much more difficult. Essentially, the union has
supported a small group of haves over a vast number of have-nots,
and it's unfortunate.''

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are different views as well on what Moriarty called
contractors' whims. ``Years ago,'' Balm said, ``a contractor could
call you and say, if you don't take this gig you'll never work in
this town again. I've been on the raw end of that, and it's not
fun. But that kind of thing is over. And the beauty of New York is
that there are other contractors and you have other options.''
</P>
<P>
Contractors, in fact, say that there is plenty of abuse on the
other side. Sell mentioned a violinist whose playing he admired but
who regularly arrived late to rehearsals. ``I didn't do anything
about it until a conductor asked me why I kept using her,'' he
said. ``So I had to not call her for a while. Then I gave her
another chance, and she was late again.''
</P>
<P>
Sell also mentioned the case of a musician who failed to turn up
three times without arranging for a substitute, as musicians are
required to do if they are going to miss a rehearsal or a
performance. The orchestra's executive director wanted to write to
the union demanding disciplinary action. Sell counseled diplomacy,
recommending that it would be better to write to the union asking
its advice. The union responded by threatening to sue the American
Symphony.
</P>
<P>
And for all the job's perquisites -- the higher pay, the feeling
of power and authority and the sense of helping shape an
orchestra's sound -- contractors sometimes find themselves pushed to
make difficult decisions. When Leon Botstein took over the American
Symphony Orchestra in 1991, he insisted that the orchestra's roster
be revamped.
</P>
<P>
``He laid it right out,'' Sell said. ``He said that there were
obvious personnel problems that would have to be fixed, and he put
that right on my plate. It meant not re-engaging musicians who had
been with the orchestra for 20 years. I lost two very close friends
because of that. People always blame the contractor because they
think you're in a position to fix it. Sometimes you are and
sometimes you can't.
</P>
<P>
``But the bottom line is that the orchestra is much better now
than it was two years ago. For me, that's the greatest satisfaction
of the job. When a concert goes well and the players leave the
stage with the feeling of having accomplished something, then you
can hold your head up.''

INVESTING: REBOUND BOLSTERS INVESTORS IN REIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-MONEY-INVESTING-REITS-ART-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors in real estate stocks have developed a case of
whiplash this year.
</P>
<P>
On top of three years of double-digit gains -- fueled largely by
record low interest rates -- the stocks cruised upward in the first
half of 1994 even when rates began to rise. Their strength belied
the conventional wisdom that the category was sensitive to interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
But the stocks soon slid into reverse. As a pattern of rising
rates became apparent and new offerings of real estate investment
trusts glutted the market, the total return on REITs, which are
pools of real estate or mortgages that trade as stocks, plunged
10.4 percent from June through November. That pushed the group to a
5 percent loss for the year, the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts reported.
</P>
<P>
In December, REIT's staged a strong rally. Now money managers
and REIT financial analysts are pointing to the rebound as proof
that the overall decline this year is nothing more than a
long-overdue correction in a continuing bull market.
</P>
<P>
At the least, the recent surge has eased some of the pain for
investors. Real estate mutual funds, which buy REITs, were the
best-performing fund sector for December, rising 6.89 percent on
average through Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services,
a mutual fund research firm in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
And one young fund, American Capital Real Estate of Houston,
gained 9.3 percent. Over all, real estate funds were down 3.28
percent for the year through Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
Many financial analysts expect the rebound to continue for weeks
as bottom-feeders troll for cheap shares. And for the longer term,
they suggest the worst is over for many REITs. That makes the
sector attractive for investors seeking high income,
diversification and maybe even a hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
``We have seen the bottom of the REIT market, and it has been
firming in the past few weeks,'' said James W. Williams, a senior
real estate analyst and vice president at Prudential Securities in
New York.
</P>
<P>
As of Nov. 30, the average yield on REITs was 8.1 percent,
compared with less than 3 percent for the basket of stocks in the
SP 500. The spread between those yields recently hit six
percentage points, something that occurred only twice before, in
the early 1970s and in 1990, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the commercial real estate market appears to be on
the rebound after bottoming out in 1993, said Lee Schalop, a real
estate analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
But skeptics can be found. Frederick S. Carr, president of the
Penobscot Group, a REIT research group in Boston, warned that the
stocks could plunge to the depressed levels of November if rates
rise again. He predicts that when REITs do recover, a new
generation of companies will lead the way.
</P>
<P>
As promising stocks, he cited Developers Diversified of Moreland
Hills, Ohio, which owns shopping centers mainly in the East and
Midwest, and Post Properties of Atlanta, which develops and
operates apartment complexes in the Southeast. Both companies have
experienced management, proven assets, low debt and adequate
capital.
</P>
<P>
This year gave rise to 40 initial public offerings of REITs,
bringing the number publicly traded to 227, up from 66 in 1982. But
the industry owns less than 2 percent of the nation's commercial
real estate.
</P>
<P>
``The market is still young,'' Williams said, ``and we are early
in the cycle of securitizing real estate.''

FINANCIAL ADVISERS TO THE RICH SET CONSERVATIVE COURSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-MONEY-BESSEMER-TRUST-ART-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Got a cool $10 million to invest? Whoever Publisher's Clearing
House catapults into that elite group on Super Bowl Sunday will
have a whole new range of investing options, including the money
management services of Bessemer Trust.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1907 to manage the $50 million fortune of the steel
magnate Henry Phipps, the trust company can point to a blue-blood
client list that has even included a blind trust for President
George Bush. The typical portfolio is $12 million, and the minimum
a far-from-shabby $5 million.
</P>
<P>
Those who make the cut can drop by Bessemer's oak-paneled
offices near Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, or if suffering from
post-holiday exhaustion, ask a team of its financial advisers to
make a house call.
</P>
<P>
For everyone outside that moneyed orbit who wonders what such
advice is like, Bessemer Trust agreed to lay out its investment
suggestions for the coming year. And it conceded that in one way at
least, the rich are not very different after all; they, too, had a
disappointing year in the markets.
</P>
<P>
The balanced-growth portfolio recommended by Bessemer Trust a
year ago would have lost 1 percent to 2 percent of its value by
year-end, estimated Robert C. Elliott, senior executive vice
president of the firm, which has $9 billion under management. At
the outset, Bessemer projected returns of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously, one is not happy not to reach the historical
return,'' Elliott said, but ``our clients realize that 1994 was an
aberration.'' He also noted that Bessemer's recommendation for 1993
would have produced a return of nearly 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Michael Stolper of Stolper  Co. in San Diego, which evaluates
money managers, said equity managers' returns this year were
clustered around zero, and he said Bessemer's performance was
typical.
</P>
<P>
He noted, though, that fees at such prestigious firms, which
boast of their personal service and their attention to everything
from estate planning to tax advice, typically run 1 percent for the
first $5 million of assets managed.
</P>
<P>
In terms of investing, ``You could probably go out and buy the
average mutual fund and do just as well,'' Stolper said.
</P>
<P>
Investors everywhere may be heartened to learn that Bessemer's
professionals expect a better year in 1995, with returns on its
model portfolio nearing 10 percent. But an air of caution remains.
``We're going to be slightly more conservative than we were last
year,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the money managers who cater to the wealthy
sound rather conservative. None of those reached for this article
recommended putting more than 65 percent of one's assets in stocks.
</P>
<P>
Bessemer's model portfolio for 1994 was 75 percent in stocks,
and it is scaling back that portion to 65 percent for the coming
year. Among its competitors, the U.S. Trust Company of New York
also pegs stocks at 65 percent, unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The investment subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corp. of New York, known
as SBC Portfolio Management International, suggests 50 percent in
stocks, up from 46 percent a year ago, but shy of the 60 percent it
calls typical.
</P>
<P>
Bessemer rounds out its portfolio with 10 percent in real estate
and private investments and 25 percent in a broad bond category.
The bond portion is split into three equal piles of short-term cash
equivalents, long-term Treasuries and medium-term issues, mostly
tax-free municipals.
</P>
<P>
``Bonds may well be the place to be in 1995,'' Elliott said.
Interest rates are peaking, municipal bonds are in short supply and
investors have overreacted to the Orange County bankruptcy and
other municipalities' financial foibles, he said. After some price
erosion early in the year, he predicted, municipal and Treasury
bonds will finish 1995 with total returns of perhaps 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Frederick B. Taylor, chief investment officer of U.S. Trust,
where the typical portfolio runs $25 million, suggests keeping
bonds at 35 percent but shifting into issues with maturities of 5
to 15 years, from 1 to 7 years now.
</P>
<P>
Similarly bullish on bonds, the Swiss Bank officials expanded to
30 percent from 27 percent the bond portion of what they call their
balanced growth accounts, which average $3 million.
</P>
<P>
Over all, they are a bit more aggressive than they were a year
earlier, as indicated by moves both to more stocks and to less
cash, down to 20 percent from 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
``We expect a tough year with returns of 5 to 10 percent, but
not as difficult as 1994 because the bond market won't detract as
much from equities,'' said Lydia J. Miller, the director of SBC. A
year ago, the firm predicted a 5 percent gain but said investors
merely came out even.
</P>
<P>
Among equities, Bessemer has dumped most financial and other
cyclical stocks, whose earnings will be under pressure if the
economy slows, as well as manufacturing companies like Raytheon and
Burlington Northern, Elliott said. It continues to favor technology
companies, especially software and telecommunications concerns.
</P>
<P>
For the coming year, it suggests reducing large U.S. stocks to
about 30 percent of a portfolio, from 40 percent, trimming foreign
exposure to 25 percent, from 27 percent, and increasing the share
in small emerging-growth companies to 10 percent from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
American companies with global operations account for 25 percent
to 30 percent of U.S. Trust's portfolio, up from 18 percent a year
ago, Taylor said. Pepsico, Kellogg and Motorola make his list.
</P>
<P>
Other picks are companies poised to benefit from the aging
population, including Johnson  Johnson, health-maintenance
organizations and companies like Conagra that sell prepared meals.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, Bessemer recommends putting 40
percent of one's foreign equity investments in emerging markets,
including Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, it is shifting from the West to other countries. In
Poland, it likes the engineering group Elektrim; in Turkey it
favors a linens producer called Arcelik, and in Russia it is
considering oil exploration and production companies.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. Trust and SBC are more wary of emerging markets. ``We
are not in Latin America,'' Ms. Miller of SBC said. ``I'll wait
until I see more stability.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trust has loaded up for now on American companies that sell
to Latin America and Asia, but likes the long-term prospects in
those stock markets. ``We think continued volatility in both
regions will provide buying opportunities,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
On another front, Bessemer stands apart from the pack. It is
increasing its real estate and private venture recommendation to 10
percent of the model portfolio from 5 percent a year ago. Among its
picks are office buildings and shopping centers in suburban Boston
and Washington, where property prices are low.
</P>
<P>
Forseeing a year of slower economic growth in the United States,
a pickup in growth abroad and the possibility of a capital gains
tax cut, Elliott expects investors to breathe a sigh or relief and
perhaps crack a smile at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
``The biggest risk will be whether a combined tax-spending
package out of Washington will increase the deficit or lead to
higher interest rates,'' he said.

STRATEGIES: FOR A DEAL ON WRAP ACCOUNTS, JUST ASK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-MONEY-STRATEGIES-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are not advertising it, but brokerage firms are lowering
the fees on their popular wrap accounts.
</P>
<P>
Generally open to people with $100,000 to invest, a wrap account
is overseen by a brokerage consultant who analyzes the client's
needs and then places the money with an outside money manager. The
lure is the prospect of a top-notch manager who would not normally
bother with an account of less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
Critics have long complained that the annual cost of such
accounts is too high -- up to 3 percent of assets on portfolios
smaller than $500,000. The firms counter that the pricing formula
is intended to reassure investors that their holdings will not be
churned to bolster transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
No matter, change is rumbling through the industry. In a survey
earlier this year, Cerulli Associates of Boston found that the fee
on the typical brokerage wrap account had fallen to about 2.3
percent, with even bigger discounts available, depending on the
size of the account and the type of investments held.
</P>
<P>
But an examination of several firms' literature shows that
published costs remain as high as ever, suggesting that investors
need to ask for the lower prices to get them.
</P>
<P>
Cerulli said that brokerage houses were sometimes discounting
their published fees from 3 percent to as little as 1.2 percent.
``A year ago the houses were far less flexible,'' said Mary
McAvity, a consultant with Cerulli, which advises the financial
services industry.
</P>
<P>
Several factors have conspired to push down wrap fees: new rules
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, investor disappointment
this year, criticism by the financial press and greater
competition.
</P>
<P>
In April, the SEC offered new regulations on wrap accounts after
it found that many investors did not understand the layered fees --
with part going to the brokerage firm and part to the outside
manager -- and that those fees were often excessive.
</P>
<P>
As of October, brochures for the accounts must outline fee
schedules, list additional charges and say if fees are negotiable,
said Robert Plaze, an SEC official
</P>
<P>
Several brochures, including those from Smith Barney and
Prudential Securities, indicate that the total fee for an account
of less than $500,000 remains 3 percent in general.
</P>
<P>
Yet, on the typical portfolio of $240,000, the average cost was
2.3 percent, Cerulli found in its survey of 100 brokerage firms at
the end of the first quarter. About 90 percent of the respondents
said fees could be negotiated, Ms. McAvity said.
</P>
<P>
Most wrap account contracts allow investors to quit or
renegotiate at any time. ``You could sign today and change your
mind tomorrow,'' said Derick Driemeyer, senior vice president of
A.G. Edwards  Sons, who added that his clients had been
negotiating more as the financial markets weakened.
</P>
<P>
At the least, investors can request changes to take effect at
the start of the next quarter, when a new billing period begins.
</P>
<P>
The first step is to ask other firms for a quote. ``Play off one
against the other,'' advised Janice Johnson, a tax lawyer with
Coopers  Lybrand, the accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
Concessions may depend in part on the portfolio. An account
composed mostly of bonds should cost less to manage than an
aggressive portfolio of stocks, Ms. McAvity said.
</P>
<P>
Another way to save is to ask the firm to split transaction fees
and management fees -- called ``unbundling.'' Bertram J. Schaeffer,
a partner with the national accounting firm of Ernst  Young, said
most investors were better off with an all-inclusive fee their
first year because many purchases would be made. But ``buy and
hold'' investors may want to switch afterward.
</P>
<P>
At A.G. Edwards, for example, the total fee on a wrap account is
up to 3 percent, with the consulting fee typically accounting for 2
percent. By paying for transactions separately, the consulting fee
drops to 1 percent. The firm's literature says transactions are
then handled at a preferential commission rate.
</P>
<P>
But critics are not satisfied. Victoria Felton-Collins, a
partner in Keller, Coad  Collins, a fee-only financial planning
firm in Irvine, Calif., said a $250,000 balanced account split
evenly in stocks and bonds would pay a first-year fee of about 1.3
percent at her firm. ``We think the person paying for a wrap
account is paying more for the service than they should,'' she
said.

CLAIMS DEADLINE IS NEAR FOR PRUDENTIAL INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-MONEY-PRU-CLAIMS-ART--NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time is running out for thousands of people to lay claim to a
restitution fund created by Prudential Securities, which has set
aside $660 million to compensate investors who were defrauded in
the sales of its limited partnerships in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Claim forms are to be filed within one year, and since
Prudential says all of the forms were postmarked by Jan. 10, 1994,
only days remain for them to be returned. Although many people find
the process and the paperwork confusing, there is every reason to
submit a claim, plaintiff's lawyers and regulators say.
</P>
<P>
``For the cost of a few stamps, investors can determine if they
are eligible to take advantage of the process,'' said Philip A.
Feigin, the Colorado securities commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The claim is the last chance for many people who bought into the
Prudential partnerships. That is because the statute of limitations
for an arbitration or court proceeding is generally two to six
years, while such limits have been waived for the restitution fund.
</P>
<P>
Prudential initially put $330 million into the pool as part of a
settlement with regulators, and later raised the total to $660
million. Its liability is unlimited, meaning the final tally could
go higher.
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 17, 152,000 investors had submitted claims and 56,000
of them had received $392 million, said Joel F. Brenner, a lawyer
with Storch  Brenner, a Washington firm assisting with the
restitution.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30,000 investors are still on the sidelines, said
Wayne Klein, the bureau chief of the Idaho Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
About 340,000 investors poured $8 billion into 700 Prudential
limited partnerships. The partnerships eventually turned sour,
creating losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Not all of those investors are eligible for restitution,
however. The vast majority of the 130,000 who bought energy-income
partnerships accepted a $90 million class-action settlement earlier
this year. They are precluded from participating now, as are others
who have already been to arbitration or to court or who have
reached a settlement with the firm. Furthermore, some of the
investors are now dead.
</P>
<P>
The pace of filings has picked up in the last month, Brenner
said. Weekly filings are averaging 3,000, double the level of a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
For restitution, claimants must show that the investments were
unsuitable for them, that they were misled by marketing or that
they did not receive full and fair disclosure. If they are not
satisfied with the offer they receive, they may still turn to
arbitration -- but they must act within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Investors who have not yet submitted forms can receive
assistance by calling (800) 774-0700.

TREATMENT OF SEVERANCE

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IRAS AND BENEFICIARIES
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a widow who will be 70 and a half in 1995, so I must
start withdrawals from my individual retirement account. My
beneficiaries are my three children, all of whom are, of course,
more than 10 years younger than I. How do I figure the required
minimum distribution? Does having more than one beneficiary change
the rules? Lore Jarmul, Southbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
A: For withdrawal purposes, all your beneficiaries are deemed to
be 10 years younger, explained Seymour Goldberg, a lawyer in Garden
City, N.Y., who is a specialist in retirement distributions. For
this reason, you need to use a special number based on life
expectancies to calculate your distributions. Details can be found
in Appendix E of Publication 590 from the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
In your case, Goldberg said, to calculate the minimum withdrawal
amount for 1995, you look at your account balance as of Dec. 31,
1994, and divide by 26.2 (as explained in the booklet). The
following year, you would divide by 25.3 and then 24.4 the
subsequent year.
</P>
<P>
When you die, the life expectancy of your oldest child at the
time that you turned 70 would become crucial. Suppose she was 45.
That would give her a life expectancy of 37.7 years when you turned
70. If you take distributions for five years before you die, your
children would subtract those five years from 37.7, meaning they
would have to take the remaining money over a period of 32.7 years.
</P>
<P>
To protect their right to stretch out the payment period, the
children must maintain the account in your name after your death.
The children can split it into three chunks, however, so that each
controls a portion of the account, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
``They should send a letter to the institution asking to have
the account split up but maintained in your name,'' he said. For
example, the accounts might say ``Mary Smith, deceased, for the
benefit of Sally Smith.''
</P>
<P>
``The mistake many banks and brokerages make is to send a check
to the kids or roll the account over to an account for the kids,''
he said. ``Then it becomes immediately taxable.''
</P>
<P>
TREATMENT OF SEVERANCE
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the role of severance pay in Social Security
benefits? I retired in August, and am receiving 12 monthly checks
of $5,163 as severance. The money is fully taxed, but not earned
income. Does it affect Social Security benefits? What about the
Social Security tax base? Richard V. Bucaria, Middle Village,
Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
A: Severance payments made upon retirement are excluded from the
Social Security earnings test, which means your benefits will not
be reduced. These payments are included in your adjusted gross
income, however, meaning they will affect what portion of your
benefits are taxable, said Dale Detlefs, a consultant for William
M. Mercer Inc. in Louisville, Ky.

`THE NICOTINE WAR' ON PBS `FRONTLINE'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-TV-NICOTINE-REVIEW-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the lineup of tobacco company executives before a
congressional committee last year, chorusing their assurances that
nicotine is not an addictive drug and that their companies do not
manipulate the amount that goes into their cigarettes? If not, you
can see that comical display of corporationally correct thinking
Tuesday night on ``Frontline.''
</P>
<P>
``The Nicotine War'' adds little to news accounts of the
campaign by David A. Kessler, head of the Food and Drug
Administration, to demonstrate that the cigarette is a means of
transmitting nicotine into the body and hooking smokers and hence
belongs under his agency's regulatory aegis. But the program does a
tidy job of packaging a dispute that, as the narrator notes,
involves science, politics, jobs and public health.
</P>
<P>
The scientific consensus (excepting scientists in the pay of the
tobacco companies) is that nicotine is indeed highly addictive,
working on the body much like alcohol, cocaine or heroin, although
cigarette manufacturers emphasize that it does not have the
invidious effects of those drugs. (Lung cancer and heart disease
are not directly caused by nicotine.)
</P>
<P>
Whether cigarette makers purposely add the nicotine to their
tobacco is less clear, although as viewers acquainted with
``Frontline'' might expect, the report is not inclined to give the
tobacco interests the benefit of any doubt.
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest to smokers is the news that low-tar,
low-nicotine cigarettes actually have as much tar and nicotine as
any other cigarettes. The difference is in the filter. If you crave
a bigger jolt, you can cover the filter holes with your fingers or
put the cigarette deeper into your mouth and inhale strenuously.
Then you can have the comfort of smoking a seemingly safer brand
yet filling your lungs with as much foul stuff as ever.
</P>
<P>
``The Nicotine War'' ends with no truce in view. On one hand, a
billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against the tobacco companies
is being waged by an all-star band of personal-injury lawyers. On
the other, control of the House committee that was putting the heat
on the companies has passed to tobacco-state representatives more
inclined to put the heat on Kessler. Since a crackdown on
cigarettes is not part of the Republican contract with America, his
future is smoky. After the election, he canceled a scheduled
interview with ``Frontline.''

A LITTLE SEED MONEY IS PLANTED TO HELP AN ENDOWMENT GROW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-PEOPLE-BRIEFS-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., has announced the largest
gift from an alumnus in its 46-year history.

	Herbert Beigel, class of '66, has donated $3 million to the
school's theater program. In return, the university's 750-seat
theater will be renamed the Herbert and Nancy Beigel Main Stage
Theater.

	Beigel, a Chicago-based lawyer, said it was a somewhat dubious
distinction to have given the university its largest alumni gift.
``It makes me feel that there should be others making big
contributions because Brandeis has a lot of successful alumni,'' he
said on Friday in a telephone interview from his vacation home on
Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

	``Brandeis is still a fairly young institution and it's been
challenging for it to develop an endowment. Maybe my gift will
inspire other alumni to pay attention.''

	Lyle Lovett figures his 15 minutes of fame arrived when he
married Julia Roberts 18 months ago.

	The press scrutiny and public curiosity that followed their
wedding has subsided, Lovett said in an interview in Sunday's Los
Angeles Times.

	``I think I have definitely peaked in terms of pop culture,''
said Lovett, the singer-songwriter and actor. ``I don't think
anything I'll do in my life on a public level will be as
newsworthy, and maybe that's a good thing because all I'm
interested in doing is what I've always done ... write about my
life.''

	Fans still ask Lovett to sign the cover of The National
Enquirer, one of several publications that have speculated about
the state of his marriage since the couple's work schedules often
keep them apart.

	``You have to keep focused on the reality of this relationship
and not on the publicity,'' Lovett said. ``I'm married to this girl
and I am in love with her. We have a relationship that doesn't get
played in the tabloids ... what you hear about is a fictionalized
version.''

BRAZILIAN ARTISTS SHOWN IN NEW YORK GALLERIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIO DE JANEIRO  (BC-BRAZIL-ART-900(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a neighborhood that still runs a cable car,
two Brazilian artists, Waltercio Caldas and Daniel Senise, conceive
and create contemporary sculptures and paintings using two totally
individual languages.
</P>
<P>
For Caldas, the appeal of hilltop Santa Teresa is that ``it
doesn't have time, just space.'' Space has been a central concern
of Caldas for over 20 years, but his intriguing experiments with
visual perception have had relatively little exposure in the United
States. He attributes the absence of a strong Brazilian presence in
the international art world to a ``lack of consciousness of
Brazil's cultural complexity.''
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, Brazil has been more receptive to
international exchanges than it had been, both financially and
culturally. In May, Mary Sabbatino of Galerie Lelong and Lori Ledis
and Robert Flam of LedisFlam Inc., all New York art dealers, were
invited by the Brazilian Embassy in Washington to see the Sao Paulo
Bienal of 20th-Century Brazilian Artists. Ms. Sabbatino said, ``We
were bowled over by the incredible richness of the art we saw, and
we kept saying, what can we do to bring this to New York?''
</P>
<P>
Now the works of Caldas, Senise and 14 other Brazilian
contemporary artists are to be displayed in 11 exhibition spaces in
New York City. The first openings will be on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
``In America, there has been a lack of exposure to Brazilian
art,'' said Ms. Ledis, an organizer of the exhibits, collectively
titled Art From Brazil in New York, which will be partly supported
by the Brazilian Embassy and the Brazilian-American Cultural
Institute. ``There are certainly a lot of stereotypes of what Latin
American art looks like. I think people are going to be very
surprised at how conceptual, how different Brazilian art is.''
</P>
<P>
Charles Cowles, another participating gallery owner, said,
``There are certainly no parrots, no pretty hot-colored flowers.''
</P>
<P>
Historically influential artists like Mira Schendel and Helio
Oiticica, both of whom had special rooms at the recent Sao Paulo
Bienal, will represent Brazilian art that emerged during the 1950s
and 1960s. Monotypes on rice paper and a series called ``Graphic
Objects,'' dating from 1967 to 1972, by Schendel will be shown at
the Drawing Center. A 1973 audio-visual installation by Oiticica
featuring the music of Jimi Hendrix will occupy a room of the
Marian Goodman Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Caldas and Cildo Meireles, who began to explore movement and
space in the 1970s, will show sculptures and an installation, a
dark room within a room, at Galerie Lelong. Senise will exhibit
three series of paintings at the Charles Cowles Gallery. And two
newly acclaimed artists will be shown, Nuno Ramos at Brooke
Alexander and Adriana Varejao at Annina Nosei Gallery. Other
artists will be shown at the Nicole Klagsburn Gallery, the Robert
Miller Gallery and the New Museum.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Caldas, who works here in a studio overlooking
vivid orange flamboyant trees, slums and the blue expanse of
Guanabara Bay, was born in Rio. During the 1960s, he studied
painting at Rio's Museum of Modern Art and first exhibited drawings
and objects in 1967. Since then he has annually been exhibiting
what he insists on calling ``sculptural moments'' in Rio and Sao
Paulo.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, he participated in group shows in Cologne, Berlin,
Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome and Vancouver and in two in New York,
at the Museum of Modern Art and at the John Gibson Gallery. He has
created large environmental works, using materials as diverse as
plants, stones and stainless steel, for public spaces in Sao Paulo,
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and in Norway.
</P>
<P>
Caldas's interest in the relationship between materials and the
space in their midst is present in the three works that will be
shown at Galerie Lelong. ``Mirror With Light,'' from 1974, displays
a small red light emanating from an ordinary black-framed mirror.
In ``Double Untitled'' (1989), two rectangular veils are suspended
from the ceiling by nylon strings; polished brass rods hang from
the nearly transparent veils and dangle, free to move continuously,
touch one another and possibly create distinct sounds on impact. It
is an ``an image to hear,'' Caldas says.
</P>
<P>
In ``Wood-wind'' (1994) a rectangle and a diamond of
dark-grained wood hang at a steep angle from a spare, thigh-high
wood frame. The artist calls this juxtaposition of wooden angles
and air an experiment in ``structural perversity,'' because it
goads the viewer to explore the tensions in a resting object, the
possibilities of movement in what he calls the ``skin of air.''
</P>
<P>
There is also an element of mystery in the paintings of
39-year-old Daniel Senise, another carioca, or Rio native. In
paint-splattered shorts or carpenter's overalls, Senise has
recently been working with a common garden hose, hundreds of small
rusting nails, sheets of nearly transparent voile fabric and grand
canvases in two vast rooms.
</P>
<P>
He carefully aligns the nails to follow the path of a boomerang,
then sprays a canvas with water and waits to see what rust reaction
will remain once he removes the nails.
</P>
<P>
The flight of a boomerang also appears in several of Senise's
paintings to be shown in New York. ``You have the whole story in
front of you,'' he said. ``You see the beginning, the whole
trajectory, and the end. I am not showing the action, but I am
showing the history of the boomerang.''

<P>
The history of painting has been a recurring preoccupation of
Senise's, and in different series in the last few years, he has
used the well-recognized images of Caspar David Friedrich, Giotto
and James Whistler.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Senise has been regularly exhibiting in Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and has also had solo shows in Paris,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Chicago, Lisbon and Santafe, Spain, and most
recently in Monterrey, Mexico. He was one of the artists
representing Brazil at the 1990 Venice Biennale and last year at
the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
References from Giotto's ``Last Supper,'' Friedrich's
landscapes, 18th-century English silhouettes and current children's
books are used in the three other series Senise will have on
exhibit in New York.
</P>
<P>
``Daniel cannot abandon completely the image in his paintings,''
said Tomas Cohn, a gallery owner who represents Senise here. ``This
is very Latin American.''
</P>
<P>
Brazil's wealth of artistic expressions should not be readily
defined as merely another example of ``Latin American'' art,
however. As Marcoantonio Vilaca, a prominent gallery owner in Sao
Paulo, said: ``Daniel and Waltercio offer two distinct artistic
thoughts, proof of the various propositions of Brazilian art.''

ESSAY: ROYALTIES IN OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON  (BC-SAFIRE-COLUMN-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Nixon speechwriter a generation ago, I was
delighted to get a check for $150 from The New York Times for a
piece about language. I told the White House counsel I would keep
it because the article had nothing to do with my official duties
and was written on my own time.
</P>
<P>
Counsel said to send the check back. Why? Because I was working
full time for the U.S. government and it would be unethical to earn
money on the side.
</P>
<P>
I grumped about returning the payment, but was gratified we had
someone keeping the White House on the strait and narrow. (The
counsel was John Dean, who later served time and gained bankable
fame as architect of the Watergate cover-up; the only ethics he
worried about were mine.)
</P>
<P>
This episode of denial of outside income was brought to mind by
the case of speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich's $4.5 million book deal.
</P>
<P>
When first revealed, his contract to receive an advance of
royalties expected from two books caused a furor. Newt at first
dismissed the reaction as ``book envy,'' a play on ``penis envy,''
pointing to piddling advances paid to liberals in the past.
</P>
<P>
Newt had no sense of how unseemly his bonanza was -- making it
appear that the Republican scourge of society's freeloaders was
promptly cashing in on his new position.
</P>
<P>
Two critics saved his neck. Democratic whip David Bonior, always
against free trade, went overboard in professing to see a remote
conflict of interest in the deal in the control of the publisher by
Rupert Murdoch, whose interests may be affected by legislation.
Bonior's excessive, partisan blast made Newt look put-upon.
</P>
<P>
The speaker was assisted further by an editorial in The New York
Times, which suggested an apparently ethical way out: ``He can
forgo an advance and simply wait for the royalties to come in once
the books are actually on sale.''
</P>
<P>
Newt seized that opening and ran to daylight. As Bob Dole
needled him and talk show hosts hollered ``sellout,'' author
Gingrich circulated a letter to his House colleagues announcing he
would ``forgo four and a half million dollars,'' awaiting the
royalties after the books were sold.
</P>
<P>
Editorialists hailed his self-denial. Republicans in Congress
heaved a sigh of relief, as if he had dealt forthrightly with
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
But his quick fix misses the point. The ethical issue is not
whether he gets paid in advance. The issue is how much, if any,
outside income a public official should be permitted to earn while
on the public payroll.
</P>
<P>
Is it right for an elected official, drawing a salary from the
public for his full-time talents, to capitalize on the celebrity
and controversy gained through his office by writing books -- or for
that matter, by giving speeches, endorsing products or earning
outside income in any way?
</P>
<P>
It's not against the law. Nor is it unprecedented: Gingrich
showed us a list of books by legislators, including Vice President
Al Gore's ill-selling screed on the environment, written more as a
springboard for publicity than for profit. If Al can earn
thousands, why not Newt millions?
</P>
<P>
I have nothing against anybody making big money. Bleeding hearts
should note that half of Newt's earned millions will go to
government in taxes. And the public interest is served when a
sitting lawmaker invests extra personal effort in writing and
articulating political ideas.
</P>
<P>
But --
</P>
<P>
Outside earning, drawn from memoirs of public service, or made
possible by the celebrity gained by a time in office, should await
the end of that service. That's what presidents have always done;
that's what Gen. Colin Powell properly did in his $6 million deal.
To make serious money, first get out of government.
</P>
<P>
While in office, when books, CD-ROMs or profit-making on-line
services are undertaken, earnings should be capped; one-third of
the official's salary is reasonable. Income in excess of the cap
should go to the government, not to some preferred orphanage,
because notoriety derived from government power gives value to the
official's editorial output.
</P>
<P>
Public officials should not compete with private citizens as
providers of media content. Officeholders should not line their
pockets with the latest form of ``honest graft.''

`THE VENETIAN TWINS' BROUGHT BACK TO RIBALD LIFE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-THEATER-TWINS-REVIEW-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlo Goldoni's early comedy ``The Venetian Twins''
(1748) comes to vigorous, ribald, disorderly life in the Pearl
Theater Company's production of a translation by Michael Feingold,
directed by John Rando.
</P>
<P>
The play dates from a time when Goldoni was struggling to
transport Venetian theater from the commedia dell'arte's wild
improvisations on a bare scenario to the performance of fully
written plays, and it has remnants of the commedia's slapstick
along with an arsenal of tricks Goldoni devised to grab an
audience's attention. The Pearl's version is wonderfully fresh,
even if its exuberance at times reminds one of some stage
experiments of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Rando and the actors approach Goldoni's contorted plot with the
boisterous humor the playwright intended, often mocking it in
asides to the audience, which he also wanted.
</P>
<P>
There are elaborate schemes over a horde of jewels and gold,
sword fights, fistfights, love duets, seduction attempts,
flirtations with incest, battles with the law and endless
confusions of identity, especially between twin brothers who have
not seen each other in many years and who turn up in the same town
on the same day. Goldoni even had the effrontery to include a
murder and a suicide in this overstuffed bag of laughter, and they
are surprisingly amusing.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding in this good cast are Arnie Burton as the twins, one
foolish, lustful and rich and the other ridiculously honorable;
Robin Leslie Brown as an impudent maid with an eye for aroused men;
Clement Fowler as a bumbling hypocrite, a kind of rural Tartuffe,
and Kevin Black as a competitor in romance to the honorable twin,
one of the more endearing idiots in stage literature.
</P>
<P>
Renzo Antonello's masks for the few characters still dressed in
commedia dell'arte garb are splendid little works of art. Deborah
Rooney's costumes are designed in every case to accommodate the
elaborate sleights all the characters use to produce comic effects.
And the fight direction by Rick Sordelet is superb; a couple of the
sword fights here are astonishingly swift, elegant and funny at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
All in all, good Goldoni: slapstick all right, but sharpened by
satire, intelligence and style.
</P>

BROTHER ROGER CALLS, AND 110,000 YOUTHS RESPOND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS  (BC-FRANCE-RALLY-660ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before Brother Roger spoke, young people from all over
Europe were already kneeling in prayer, leaning on backpacks,
singing hymns or just sleeping by the glow of a sea of candles.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 strong, they had come from more than 30
nations -- Orthodox Christians from Russia and the Balkans,
Protestants and Catholics from north and south. They had filled
five cavernous exhibition halls and transformed the chilly sites
into spaces of meditation, warmed by red banners, religious icons
and a pervasive sense of calm.
</P>
<P>
``We have come here to search, or to go on searching through
silence and prayer, to get in touch with our inner life,'' Brother
Roger said to a vast congregation in jeans and anoraks, who
listened to his words as they were translated into 19 languages.
``Christ always said: do not worry, give yourself.''
</P>
<P>
Through simple words and music, Brother Roger, 79, a Swiss
Protestant theologian and his ecumenical community of monks have
been addressing the challenge that many say organized religion on
this continent has widely failed to meet: how to awaken
Christianity among young people growing up in a secular world?
</P>
<P>
The 90 monks in white robes include Lutheran, Anglican and
Evangelical members as well as Roman Catholics. They speak in plain
language instead of traditional church oratory. Their chants merge
the meditative prayers of Orthodox and Western monasteries.
</P>
<P>
Above all, they never preach. Rather, they say, their role is to
question and understand and help others in their inner search.
</P>
<P>
``My brothers and I want to be seen as people who listen, never
as spiritual masters,'' was the phrase that Brother Roger used.
</P>
<P>
A measure of the quiet force of the monks, the Taize Community,
is that the annual meetings they have organized since 1978 have now
snowballed into the vast gathering of 110,000 people for five days
of discussion and prayer that is ending in Paris on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brother Roger began his community in 1940. He was Roger Schutz
then, the son of a Swiss Calvinist pastor. He and three friends had
the idea that war could be averted if Christians could unite, and
they bought a house in Taize in eastern France to be their
headquarters. During the war, before they were known as a formal
community, they hid refugees, including Jews.
</P>
<P>
In the postwar years as Communism spread, the community grew and
members traveled as tourists to Eastern Europe, quietly setting up
prayer circles among young Catholics in Poland and Hungary and
Protestants in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Their long presence in the former Soviet bloc, the organizers
said, explains why almost half the participants in Paris last week
came from Eastern Europe. Many spent two and three days snaking
their way to Paris on precarious-looking buses from as far away as
Moscow, Athens, Warsaw and Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the New Year program have created a presence
in Paris, with their vehicles inevitably clogging the city's
traffic and with the backpackers surging into streets and subways.
</P>
<P>
``The prayers and the discussion help us so much,'' said Sonia
Verger, a chemistry student who helps AIDS patients in her spare
time and attends a Taize prayer group once a week in Lyons, France.
</P>
<P>
Gregor Puchala from Katowice was part of Poland's delegation,
the biggest, with 40,000 people.
</P>
<P>
``The religion part is good but young people also see this as a
way to see the world,'' he said. ``It's very cheap. I went to the
Eiffel Tower and found a lot of other Poles.''
</P>
<P>
Brother Emile, a Canadian member of the Taize community, does
not object. ``We're not naive,'' he said. ``We know that Paris is
an attraction in itself. But our purpose is to bring young people
together.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
The last meeting in Paris, in 1988, drew 33,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Organizing the event has been tantamount to logistic acrobatics.
More than 40,000 participants were housed in private homes,
schools, sports and church halls and even military bases.
</P>
<P>
At the Porte de Versailles, the center of activities, French
soldiers set up 20 mobile field kitchens to heat a mind-boggling
100,000 C-rations for each night's dinner -- provided for $1 each by
the German army.
</P>
<P>
And so it was that a group from the Ukraine, holding cans of
hamburgers, was testing out a version of English on Italians
gobbling up military lentils and sausages. By Saturday, the word
was out that Serbs and Croats had prayed together the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
``We still cannot believe we are really here,'' said Alexandra
Bobric, a member of a Christian Orthodox parish in Belgrade,
Serbia, recounting how the Serb contingent needed visas from
Hungary, Austria, Germany and France to get here. ``But we really
needed this. At home we're at the end of our rope.''
</P>
<P>
Tim Wilkins, 24, visiting from Brooklyn, knew of the Taize
Brothers through their small community in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
``What we hear about Europe is about war and conflict,'' said
Wilkins, who completed his degree in political science at Amherst
College. ``This is extraordinary. It's spiritual and it's about
friendship, about building a network of trust.''
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, in Hall Two, thousands sat on the concrete
floor, chanting and sharing texts. It was a stirring occasion, yet
not grand by the standards of modern mass events. There were no
giant monitoring screens, no outsize stage or spotlights.
</P>
<P>
``To me this is wonderful,'' said Karla Hudelja, an economics
student from Lubljana, Slovenia. ``First I loved the music because
I play the flute. Now I understand young people need God. This is
the time we must decide about our life, so we need calm inside.''
</P>
<P>
Monday she was off home again, with 3,000 others from Slovenia.
The buses, they hoped, would swing once last time past the
Cathedral of Notre Dame.

IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, DRUG TRADE THRIVES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-NY-CRIME-II-600(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Danny Cabero returned recently from two years in
prison for drug possession he hardly recognized his old turf in
Washington Heights, where streets were once congested with young
men hawking drugs to drive-by addicts, and guns and knives were a
preferred means of communication.
</P>
<P>
``It's quiet,'' said Cabero, 20, who went back this spring to
the northern Manhattan neighborhood that became a landmark in the
nation's cocaine crisis. ``They have less people selling drugs in
the street. Less people robbing. One thing you can say about
Washington Heights: you can walk down the street here and be
safe.''
</P>
<P>
Although there is no evidence that the drug trade has diminished
significantly, it has become less violent. With the sharp decline
in the city's crime rate, Washington Heights offers evidence that
the deadly edge of the drug business has dulled, at least
momentarily, with police strategies more effective and some turf
wars between dealers now settled.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, when those wars were raging, 119 people were killed in
Washington Heights; last year the number fell to 56. Shootings
dropped by a quarter from 1993 to 1994. And possibly as a result of
an increased police presence in the neighborhood, reports of other
crimes, like auto theft and grand larceny, fell significantly last
year.
</P>
<P>
With legions of former drug sellers now consigned to either
cells or coffins, both the police and residents say there are fewer
new recruits taking their places on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Everyone has his own barometer for the drop in crime. The Rev.
Earl Kooperkamp, of the Church of the Intercession at 155th Street
and Broadway, says he is rarely harassed by drug dealers now. ``It
used to be constant,'' he said. ``When I was driving around making
parish visits -- a white guy in a Jeep -- it was constant soliciting:
`Hey, Popi. What do you want? What do you
want?' ''
</P>
<P>
While new programs in Washington Heights are offering youths
alternatives to the street and more tenant groups are fighting
drugs in their buildings, the biggest changes in crime appear
linked to police efforts and changes in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
These days, the police see more organization and sophistication
among dealers, whose operations have been forced from the streets
into apartment buildings by years of enforcement pressure.
</P>
<P>
Narcotics officers say knots of street dealers have been
replaced by a handful of ``steerers'' on the sidewalk, directing
customers to apartments outfitted as sales offices. The men on the
street use electronic buzzers and walkie-talkies to warn those
inside about the nearby police.
</P>
<P>
Many of the apartments are furnished with nothing more than a
desk or two, scales for weighing drugs and nearly-invisible
custom-made compartments for hiding contraband.
</P>
<P>
When officers raided an apartment on 190th Street recently, they
made five arrests and seized 25 pounds of cocaine and two guns. But
what surprised them most was the network of video cameras trained
on the street to spot police activity.
</P>
<P>
Many drug dealers now use one apartment for transactions and
others, blocks away, to stash larger amounts of drugs and money.
And the police say cars that carry drugs are being customized so
that the push of a hidden button opens a secret compartment in the
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
``It's more secretive and better hidden now,'' said Richard
Wells, a police officer in Washington Heights for the last four
years. ``It was so blatant before.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
The crack explosion of the mid-1980s transformed the side
streets of Washington Heights into wholesale cocaine supermarkets
minutes from New Jersey, Westchester County and other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
In July 1986, in an undercover political event to show how open
the selling had become, Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, put on a leather vest and sunglasses, and together
with Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, who wore a windbreaker and Army cap,
bought crack as part of a buy-and-bust operation on 160th Street.
</P>
<P>
The market overwhelmed both the police and the new Dominican
population, which had grown in Washington Heights since the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Washington Heights is still a favored destination for cocaine
buyers, and the police say heroin -- which preceded cocaine as the
main drug available in the neighborhood -- is now being sold with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
But much is different. The number of police officers has
increased to 445 from 338 in the last two years. The police
precinct itself has been split in two, creating another station
house for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Community policing programs, expanded under the Dinkins
administration, have more officers walking beats. And new powers
granted to street officers by the Giuliani administration allow
them to investigate and arrest drug sellers, augmenting the
department's narcotics division, which previously handled most drug
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Through mid-December, the police made more than 2,800 drug
arrests in Washington Heights in 1994, nearly 35 percent more than
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
``A couple of years ago, we'd see these guys in the street; we
knew they were drug dealers, but we'd just pass them by,'' said
Dennis Rodriguez, an officer who has patrolled some of the most
drug-infested streets of Washington Heights. ``Maybe we would just
tell them to move on. But when you went off the block, they came
back. We were handcuffed.''
</P>
<P>
The department has tried a variety of other strategies,
including seizing the cars of buyers who travel across the George
Washington Bridge and from other areas to make their purchases. And
although the volume of the drug business cannot be measured, both
the police and residents say it has slowed slightly.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has pushed some drug activity south to Harlem, and
some New York drug dealers have moved to less competitive markets
upstate and in other East Coast cities, say both the police and
others familiar with the drug business.
</P>
<P>
The trade is still composed of mostly small operations, each run
by fewer than a dozen people, police officials say. The difference
now is that is that fewer of these operations exist. ``On one block
you could have three or four major players,'' Rodriguez said.
``Five years ago on these blocks you could hardly get down the
street, there were so many guys. And there were shootouts all the
time because of the competition.''

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officials say those battles -- which drew police attention
and hurt the drug business -- have been quelled to some degree by
understandings between dealers about who controls which areas.
</P>
<P>
``It's like the Mafia,'' said John Coyne, a lieutenant in the
33d Precinct in the lower half of Washington Heights. ``You go back
50 or 60 years and they were killing each other right and left, but
you put someone in charge, and they know the rules and they don't
kill each other as much.''
</P>
<P>
To community leaders, the reduction in crime also reflects an
evolution of the immigrant community, which has increased its
political power and expanded organizations to combat a host of
ills, from apartment overcrowding to the high rate of school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
``It's the normal growth and development of the community,''
said Victor Morisete, the executive director of the Community
Association of Progressive Dominicans. ``When you have a stake in
where you live, you will think differently, you will treat that
area differently, and crime is one of the things that is
affected.''
</P>
<P>
A turning point for the neighborhood was five days of
disturbances in July 1990 ignited by the killing of Jose (Kiko)
Garcia, a drug suspect, by Officer Michael O'Keefe during a
scuffle. Although the officer was eventually cleared, the killing
raised the suspicions of many residents that the police were
abusive and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
At the time, crime seemed boundless, and the influx of young
immigrants had overwhelmed the already-crowded schools. Many had
turned to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
``I felt that perhaps we were threatened in a way we never were
before,'' said Guillermo Linares, the first Dominican immigrant
elected to the City Council in 1991. ``It was overwhelming to see
people standing on the street and knowing that there is something
going on that is not right and that the only way to confront it is
if the whole community comes together to confront it.''
</P>
<P>
The disturbances, with overturned cars aflame and the police
under attack from flying rocks and bottles, opened a pressure valve
in Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
Since then, residents' requests for more officers have been
answered, and community and police officials have tried to erase
stereotypes of all cops as corrupt thugs and all young immigrants
as gun-packing drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
The redoubled focus on Washington Height's youths can be seen
daily behind the battered brown doors of PS 143, where an
after-school program of athletics, academics and crafts attracts
hundreds of young people, from pre-teen students to former convicts
wearing gang beads.
</P>
<P>
``This becomes like a surrogate home for these kids,'' said
Eddie Silverio, a program director.
</P>
<P>
At the school on a recent night, Silverio asked Cabero about the
10 closest friends he had before he went to prison. ``Those 10
people,'' Cabero said, ``are now behind the walls of Sing-Sing,
Attica ... ''
</P>
<P>
Silverio motioned to another man in the room that night. Milton
Martinez, 28, who described himself as the leader of the Netas gang
in Washington Heights, is a former drug dealer who has served
sentences for robbery and attempted murder. Released this fall, he
swears he is a changed man.
</P>
<P>
Silviero said reducing crime over the long term may require more
than just putting people in prison and putting more police officers
on the street, especially in neighborhoods where the economy is
fragile and financing for youth programs is scarce.
</P>
<P>
``There are no jobs,'' Silverio said. ``What's Milton going to
do to survive?''
</P>
<P>
Next: In a Brooklyn neighborhood, reported crime is down, but
gangs are increasing and people are as fearful as ever.

SAUSAGE SNACK SHAPES UP FOR THE '90S
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-FOOD-OWEN-SPI)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let it be recorded for the edification of future historians. It
was in the year 1994 that the Skinnies won the war. During that
same 12-month span the Forces of Fat pulled down their colors, then
reluctantly raised a white flag.
</P>
<P>
The surrender document was initialed by Jimmy Dean. In place of
ink, he signed with melted Velveeta cheese.
</P>
<P>
For years we have been hearing about The New American Diet, high
in oat bran and veggies, low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Yet
if you walked into a typical American diner on a Sunday morning,
you could not help but notice that most of the visitors were
putting away four-egg omelets oozing with cheese. Included were
side orders of hash browns crisped in the fat of the bacon that
also rested on the enormous breakfast platters.
</P>
<P>
People talked thin. But they ate fat.
</P>
<P>
All that began to change in 1994. Who told me? Jimmy Dean. And
those Kraft executives identified as members of the Velveeta
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Check it out. It was in 1994 that both Jimmy Dean sausage and
Velveeta cheese appeared on the grocery shelves with low-fat
products. The package labels suggest that the sausage and the
cheese, combined, contain less saturated fat than a Spaulding
tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
OK, purists may insist that Velveeta is not really a cheese, in
either of its forms. And pig farmers may argue that Jimmy Dean's
low-fat breakfast meat is not really sausage, since most of the
pork has been replaced by lean turkey meat.
</P>
<P>
But the new products were enthusiastically welcomed by me.
Because once again, with a clear conscience, I can enjoy my
favorite holiday cocktail snack.
</P>
<P>
Using the new ingredients it will hereafter be known as:
</P>
<P>
NEW AGE SAUSAGE SNACK
</P>
<P>
1 package (12 oz.) Jimmy Dean low-fat sage sausage
</P>
<P>
1 pound low-fat Velveeta, in hunks
</P>
<P>
1 pound extra lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
1 chopped onion
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
One-half teaspoon garlic salt
</P>
<P>
One-half teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
Cocktail rye bread
</P>
<P>
Plop the sausage, onion and ground beef in a lightly oiled
skillet and saute until brown. Add the cheese and all the other
ingredients. When the cheese has melted you're in business.
</P>
<P>
Spread the glunk on the small cocktail rye rounds, place on a
cookie sheet and bake for eight minutes in a 450-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
This makes a bunch of glunk but the prepared cocktail rye
canapes can be kept almost indefinitely in a freezer, wrapped, then
baked when needed without thawing.
</P>
<P>
To properly toast the outgoing year we may need another low-fat
appetizer like this one.
</P>
<P>
BEAN DIP 1994
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, pureed
</P>
<P>
1 and one-half teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled
</P>
<P>
One-half teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
One-half teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
1 can (8 oz.) tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
1 can (16 oz.) vegetarian refried beans
</P>
<P>
Cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
Combine the garlic, salt and spices in a bowl and mix.
</P>
<P>
In a skillet, cook the onions in the hot oil. When they begin to
soften add the ingredients of the bowl and stir-cook for a full
minute. Add the tomato sauce and cook another two minutes. Stir in
the beans and, when the dip is well mixed, add cayenne pepper to
your taste.
</P>
<P>
Serve at room temperature with taco chips or crackers.
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah, 1994 also saw the introduction of the no-fat cherry
fudge sundae.
</P>
<P>
Was this a great year or what?!

CONSULTANT WANTS TO TAKE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT SAFETY NET

<DATELINE>
 (BC-GOP-BRAINTRUST-SPI)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morris Shechtman travels North America advising corporations on
how to operate and motivate in a risky global business culture that
he defines as working without a net.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile change management consultant has acquired a
new, high-profile client who wants to make lots of changes:
incoming Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman is a leading member of Gingrich's brain trust,
advising the incoming speaker and House Republicans on how to
sidetrack the social engineering by government that he blames for
most of society's problems.
</P>
<P>
``The foundation is being laid for some of the most significant
changes in American society in this century,'' Shechtman said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
``It is a heavy-duty culture change that is about to occur in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
Shechtman is committed to ending what he describes as
``caretaking'' by government. He sees ``this massive, wasteful
federal bureaucracy'' as the enemy of rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
``Liberals are driven with the fantasy of a pain-free
environment,'' argued Shechtman. ``The only pain-free environment
is death.''
</P>
<P>
In Shechtman's view, the new Republican majority in Congress is
part of a worldwide trend toward ending government paternalism and
creating a new order governed by the free market.
</P>
<P>
``The repudiation of caretaking is global,'' he said. ``The
world is unbundling caretaking.''
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has put Shechtman's book, ``Working Without a Net,'' on
his holiday reading list for House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman has conducted a six-hour seminar for the new speaker.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman is, like Gingrich, supremely self-confident and
provocative. He believes, for instance, that punishing people for
criminal behavior must be an absolute goal of society.
</P>
<P>
``We currently have a culture where we substitute help for
criminal penalties,'' he said. ``The worst thing this country ever
adopted was deterrent programs for criminal behavior. Caretaking
has created violence in America.''
</P>
<P>
Although a record 1 million people are incarcerated in America,
Shechtman wants more prisons. ``We're going to have to have
institutions that keep these people out of the culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He is also sympathetic to Gingrich's idea of orphanages or, as
he puts it, ``community alternatives'' to violence-prone and
dysfunctional families. ``We're talking about taking kids out of
homes with parents who are animals,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman was asked about cases of abuse and neglect in
orphanages and group homes.
</P>
<P>
``When a local institution goes haywire, who can best address
it? Local people,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has made headlines and controversy by proposing radical
changes in programs for children. House Republicans are drafting
legislation to abolish federal cash payments to hundreds of
thousands of children who are considered severely disabled.
Families would get vouchers to spend on a limited program of
medical care. And the GOP wants to severely cut back the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children welfare program.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman was asked what was wrong with providing aid, with such
protection as parental leave, in the hypothetical case of a working
single mother who is trying to complete a community college degree
program.
</P>
<P>
``It keeps her dependent on a bureaucracy,'' he shot back. ``It
exemplifies a philosophy of low trust, high control. We do not
trust her to make decisions, so we control the money to her.
</P>
<P>
``What we should say is, `You get together. Tell us how you're
going to use the money. How are you going to pursue your own
development?' ''
</P>
<P>
Shechtman sees the free marketplace solving problems that
caretaking has exacerbated.
</P>
<P>
He sees a partnership developing in the workplace that will be
far better for workers than labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
``Employees who brutalize people go out of business,'' said
Shechtman. ``The system has amazing checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
Pollution problems will be solved, he argues, not by the
Environmental Protection Agency and federal laws, but by local
people standing up and saying they will not tolerate environmental
degradation. ``What external regulation ultimately does is protect
people from growth,'' said Shechtman.
</P>
<P>
He is looking forward to helping define issues, approaches and
objectives for Gingrich and the 73-member freshman class of House
Republicans. ``We need to be orchestrating the life of this country
around core values,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman was asked whether Gingrich is overreaching, and
whether the new House speaker risks getting a reputation as
overbearing or a know-it-all.
</P>
<P>
``No,'' he replied. ``we're not telling people how to think.''

MIAMI'S DEFENSE HAS BEEN SHAPING UP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI  (BC-FBN-DOLPHINS-525ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The banner hung ominously Saturday in the northwest
corner of Joe Robbie Stadium. ``Bring back Arnsparger,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
Tom Olivadotti didn't think too much of the suggestion.
Olivadotti is the Miami Dolphins' defensive coordinator. Bill
Arnsparger, once Miami's defensive coordinator, holds the same job
now with the San Diego Chargers, who will be the Dolphins' opponent
on Sunday at 4 p.m. in the American Football Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
``Those people are kind of sick,'' Olivadotti said of the
sign-writers. ``You can't please those type of fans. They're not
real fans. They're just people who want to make change for the sake
of change.''
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins enjoyed their greatest success when Arnsparger
directed the Miami defense from 1970-73. And when when he returned
for eight seasons starting in 1976, after being fired as the
Giants' head coach, Miami again achieved more defensive
respectability than it generally has without him.
</P>
<P>
But Olivadotti clearly wants Dolphins fans to show more of an
appreciation for what they have now. As he stood in the bowels of
Joe Robbie Stadium after Miami's 27-17 victory over the Kansas City
Chiefs, his face creased in a pained scowl.
</P>
<P>
``Here we've just played probably our best three defensive games
of the year and something like this comes out,'' said the man who
has been in charge of the Miami defense for eight seasons. ``I
can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins had just defeated Kansas City, in part because of
big plays by their defense. After a 17-point first half, the Chiefs
could not crack the Miami end zone.
</P>
<P>
Three times the visitors came close, and three times they were
turned away by distinctive plays. The first was an interception by
cornerback J.B. Brown after Kansas City had reached the Miami 5.
</P>
<P>
It was such an uncharacteristic mistake by quarterback Joe
Montana, he of the four Super Bowl rings, that cornerback Troy
Vincent told Brown when they reached the sideline: ``You need to
keep that ball and paint it, because you just got an interception
from a legend.''
</P>
<P>
Next, safety Michael Stewart simply stole the ball from Marcus
Allen as the running back reached the Miami 34 midway through the
final quarter.
</P>
<P>
``He only had one hand on the ball,'' Stewart said. ``I butted
him up and just worked the strip. It's something we've been
practicing since minicamp.''
</P>
<P>
Finally, Vincent, playing in deep prevent coverage,
spectacularly batted away the final Montana pass of the day, at the
Miami 8 with 21 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs must have believed Vincent when he recently described
himself as the league's top cornerback. They chose not to challenge
him.
</P>
<P>
``It was a pretty quiet day for me,'' he said. ``They only threw
my way once, and that was a 5-yard slant in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
After Montana picked the Miami defense apart in the first half,
Vincent said the secondary made one key second-half adjustment.
</P>
<P>
``We went to more man-to-man coverage,'' he said. ``That forced
Joe to make quicker decisions, and it forced his receivers to break
their routes off.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Olivadotti, whose defense had given up a total of 26 points
against Indianapolis and Detroit heading into Saturday's game, at
first said the Dolphins did nothing different defensively in the
second half against the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Informed of Vincent's statement about going to more man-to-man
coverage, Olivadotti said: ``Yes we did. But that's not something
we want to talk about. We don't want to give San Diego any help.''
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Dolphins (11-6) head to 11-5 San Diego in maybe
their best frame of mind of the season. The offense is clicking
with a honed-in Dan Marino, who completed 22 of 29 passes Saturday
for 257 yards and two touchdowns. And the defense, for a change, is
holding up its end as well.
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins have played the Chargers twice since 1992 -- winning
in Miami that season in the playoffs, 31-0, and losing in San Diego
last season, 45-20.
</P>
<P>
``I feel very confident with our team going on in the
playoffs,'' defensive end Marco Coleman said Sunday. ``I think we
have a chance against any team we play in any game.''
</P>
<P>
Brown added: ``We feel like we're going to get to the Super
Bowl. We don't feel there's any team in the AFC any better than
us.''

HEAVY FIGHTING IN STREETS OF GROZNY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GROZNY, Russia  (BC-RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-389(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war for Chechnya has turned into a vicious
block-by-block street brawl. After days of pounding the capital
from the skies, teams of Russian snipers entered central buildings
in Grozny Sunday and fired on Chechen soldiers throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Casualties were said to be heavy on both sides as the badly
outnumbered Chechen soldiers fought back ferociously, but there was
no reliable accounting of casualties on either side.
</P>
<P>
The hulks of several Russian tanks -- some with troops still in
them -- smoldered near the central train station, where much of the
heaviest fighting has taken place.
</P>
<P>
``I know only one thing,'' said Russia's chief human rights
representative. ``Today there were hundreds of victims on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
The human rights representative, Sergei Kovalev, who has
bitterly opposed the assault on Grozny, said Russian tanks were
moving through Grozny destroying anything that got in their way,
and he added that the human cost of seizing the city could be
incalculable. He has been in Chechnya since the invasion began
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Russian troops have not taken the presidential palace,
the Government Press Service in Moscow claimed Sunday night that
President Boris N. Yeltsin's troops had surrounded the building.
Fighting has continued without pause for more than a day in the
palace area downtown.
</P>
<P>
The government said Russian troops were installing mobile
kitchens in the streets to feed the Chechen population.
</P>
<P>
There was no clear information on the whereabouts of the Chechen
leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev. Earlier Sunday, Dudayev was reported
to be in a bunker near the building with a group of members of the
Russian Parliament. And Sunday night the Interfax news agency
reported that he and his bodyguards had moved to a bunker on the
outskirts of Grozny, but did not attribute the information to a
source.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, told the
Press Service that the situation in Grozny and around it ``is being
gradually normalized,'' that troops had ``blocked'' the
presidential palace, but that there was still firing around it.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow press center also acknowledged that the troops had
not been able to enter the building and that the ``situation in
Chechnya has worsened in the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
That was readily apparent Sunday as Chechen soldiers fought
regular Russian troops with grenades, machine guns and every other
explosive at their disposal. Chechen soldiers -- moving about the
city in roving gangs with no leadership or organization -- are using
grenade launchers on any Russian tank they can find.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen military leadership Sunday issued an urgent appeal
for all able-bodied men to defend the city, and thousands of
volunteers responded, streaming into the capital packed like cattle
on the back of open flatbed trucks.
</P>
<P>
``We are going to Grozny now,'' said Idris Zhandekov, as he
stood with fellow volunteers on the main southern road into Grozny
Sunday. ``Everyone is fighting. The only problem is we don't have
enough arms. Send us some Stingers please.''
</P>
<P>
Zhandekov and his underfed, poorly clothed compatriots now
threaten to tie the Russian forces in knots with guerrilla tactics
in a city many of them have known since birth.
</P>
<P>
The city was in chaos Sunday. The south was quiet, the west was
controlled by Russians, and the north and east were ablaze with
fighting. Russian artillery units continued their assault from the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
A ground war like this will be far harder for Russia than the
air war has been. The Russian forces have superior firepower and
training, but appear demoralized and divided, while the Chechen
army -- which does not even assign ranks to its soldiers -- has only
grown more committed to its cause of independence in the weeks
since Russian government troops repeatedly bombed their capital and
the villages around it.
</P>
<P>
Until Saturday, Russian military leaders seemed content to
attack the city from afar, apparently realizing that sending
soldiers into Grozny would open a dangerous new phase of the war
that could have a heavy human and political toll.
</P>
<P>
But when Russian troops charged into the center of the city on
Saturday, all that changed. Russian planes could no longer safely
bomb the capital, or bombard it with indiscriminate artillery fire,
without risking the lives of their own troops.
</P>
<P>
It is becoming clear that no matter what Russia does, the fight
for Grozny cannot be over in a day or two, as the Russian defense
minister suggested two weeks ago. The Russian public and even the
Russian military are divided on the topic, and the Chechens are
committed to their cause.
</P>
<P>
``We have the spirit,'' said Israel Abjullakhdjiev, a young
Chechen man on his way to battle Sunday with hundreds of others.
``We have nothing to lose, and we have Allah with us.''

<P>
The separatist Muslim region's chief religious leader, appearing
on the television broadcast from a bunker in the presidential
palace, offered all soldiers the opportunity to repeat the Islamic
oath that suicide fighters take before pledging to fight to the
death. Normally, the oath must be taken in person, but clerical
leaders decided that there was no time for that.
</P>
<P>
The city was carpeted in a deep fog Sunday, preventing Russian
attack helicopters from firing weapons with precision. There were
no pedestrians left on the streets. Market activity was minimal.
Cars dodged bomb craters and telephone and electrical wires that
dangled in the air.
</P>
<P>
The only major road left open to the city, approaching from the
south, was practically deserted as well. For the first time,
Russian special forces units conducted thorough searches of all
cars and people entering Chechnya from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
A BBC producer and her crew were arrested by Russian forces
Sunday as they tried to film the area of bombardment from the
village of Tolstoy-Yurt. They were being held overnight.
</P>
<P>
Every car leaving the city was filled with women, children and
elderly people. Every vehicle entering was filled with young men
taking up arms to defend the capital against the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know why we are here, why we have been sent to fight
against Russian people,'' said Vitaly Ponvin, a Russian army
private with an artillery battalion stationed just outside of
Grozny. ``I think Yeltsin is crazy. This makes no sense. It will
never end. It's worse than Afghanistan because it's in our own
land.''
</P>
<P>
That, ostensibly, is the question about which this war is being
fought. Chechen leaders say they want independence for their mostly
Muslim republic, and neither Russia nor any other world power has
ever recognized this region as anything other than a part of the
Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
``A bullet, a shell, a bomb or a missile cannot create a
border,'' said an open letter released Sunday to Russian soldiers
from a Grozny organization called the Wolves of Islam. ``This will
not end. We will sooner or later revenge ourselves upon you for the
deeds you have done today.''

WHAT THE TASTEMAKERS SEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-FOOD-1995-SPI)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Resolutions are a little like hot-from-the-oven souffles: the
idea is enticing, though collapse is usually sure and swift.
</P>
<P>
Of course, that didn't stop us from asking some of the nation's
most prominent tastemakers what they intended to make good on in
the new year -- and solicit their predictions for '95.
</P>
<P>
A no-nonsense Julia Child says she doesn't believe in making
resolutions. ``My general philosophy is, `Get it done!' '' she says
in her inimitable trill. But America's culinary heroine foresees
``more and more people returning to home cooking and enjoying it
more.''
</P>
<P>
Though the bulk of her time is spent criss-crossing the country
on behalf of the American Institute for Wine  Food -- and eating in
restaurants and hotels -- Child says, ``I like simple cuisine
bourgeois.'' (It's true: her contribution to a Christmas Eve dinner
with friends was nothing more glamorous than mashed potatoes.)
</P>
<P>
Except for dessert, or maybe the first course, Child says she
disdains ``froufrou,'' or excessive presentation. And she's weary
of raw, burned and undercooked restaurant food. ``So much of what
you see in restaurants, you don't know what you're eating.''
</P>
<P>
Another trend she hopes disappears: the ubiquitous chile pepper,
``which I've even had in dessert,'' bemoans Child.
</P>
<P>
What could America's leading authority on etiquette possibly
want to improve?
</P>
<P>
``I hope to keep myself from being judgmental -- which is very
hard in my field,'' says manners maven Letitia Baldrige. Thus, she
plans to be more trusting and encouraged by young people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Her mantra: ``Think kindness.'' Call someone who is sick.
Remember to write a thank you note. Baldrige plans to soften her
stance where feelings aren't at stake. ``If someone doesn't hold
his knife and fork properly, it isn't hurting anyone. But
responding to a dinner invitation and not showing up hurts the
hosts, the guests,'' everyone involved, she says.
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like she's lowering her standards, Baldrige points
out she's merely being less rigid. ``One has to roll with the
times, and change manners to accommodate what's happening in
society.''
</P>
<P>
What does Baldrige see in her perfectly shiny crystal ball?
``People are going to be less vocal about their dietary needs''
when being entertained. ``They'll leave discussion of diets and
calories at home.'' After all, ``invitations are drying up!'' she
says, sounding a warning to fickle eaters.
</P>
<P>
``The future is a gloomy one,'' moans Michael Jacobson,
executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest in
Washington, D.C. With the Republican march into the capitol,
Jacobson envisions a Congress that ``will pass legislation or block
introductions by Clinton that will result in a more dangerous food
supply.''
</P>
<P>
For starters, he's concerned that both nutritional standards and
funding for the national school breakfast and lunch programs will
be reduced, and that laws banning cancer-causing food additives
will be repealed.
</P>
<P>
Never one to mince words, the consumer watchdog hopes ``more and
more people will equate eating fatty food with cigarette smoking,''
lumping the two behaviors in the same class. Dietary changes are
never easy, he offers, but can be as simple as switching from 2
percent to skim milk.
</P>
<P>
Jacobson might have an ally in John Mariani, the food and travel
correspondent for Esquire magazine, who plans to eat more
vegetarian or vegetarian-leaning dishes (``easy these days''),
eschew after-dinner drinks (``digestives don't help digestion at
all''), and aim for shorter meals and fewer courses (the current
vogue for lengthy ``market'' or ``tasting'' menus ``start to lap
over into gluttony,'' he says. ``More than four courses'' is too
much).
</P>
<P>
Mariani gets around -- this year, the critic logged about 300
meals away from home, dining in 25 cities. On his hit list: food
that's been played with too much. On his wish list: chefs who take
advantage of more of what's available in the seas. Mariani says
Mediterranean and Italian themes will continue to dominate the
national dining out scene and adds, ``I have a strong suspicion
that `fusion' or Pacific Rim cooking will settle down. Chefs are
tired of working with all those strong flavors.'' In its place, he
predicts, diners will see ``more South American, Central American
and Iberian'' cooking.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to bargains, Mariani suggests that the hungry
traveler look no farther afield than his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
``America will continue to be the bargain of the entire world,''
he says, refusing to shed a tear for the demise of the $25 entree.
Now more than ever, ``our food is cheap -- and great.''

Miriam Camps, who wrote about European unification and other
topics and who had been a State Department official, died Friday in
a hospital near her home in Little Abingdon outside Cambridge,
England. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Margaret Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Camps was born Miriam Camp in Lynn, Mass. She was the first
woman to be vice chairman of the State Department's Planning
Council, from 1968 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
After earning degrees at Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr colleges,
she joined the State Department during World War II and went on to
work at the U.S. embassy in London. She worked for the State
Department in Washington from 1947 to 1953, then resigned to marry
William Anthony Camps, a classicist at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
Her many subsequent writings included the books ``Britain the
the European Community'' (1964), ``What Kind of Europe?'' (1965)
and ``European Unification in the Sixties'' (1966). She was active
in a variety of organizations concerned with foreign affairs.

BOSNIAN AND SERB COMMANDERS MEET AS CEASE-FIRE BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, Croatia  (BC-YUGOSLAVIA-BOSNIA-350ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement for a four-month cessation of
hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina took effect at noon Sunday,
and shortly afterward Bosnian government commanders met with
officers from the Bosnian Serb army they have been fighting for 33
months.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the Sarajevo airport, was the first of what
will probably be a long series of sessions at which the two sides
will negotiate details of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both sides hailed the agreement. ``We welcome it, and
we are ready to negotiate in good faith to end this conflict,''
said the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian government leaders also pledged good faith. But
President Alija Izetbegovic warned in a radio address that fighting
could resume in the spring if no final peace treaty is negotiated
by the time the cease-fire expires.
</P>
<P>
``The war must not last a day longer than it has to, but peace
at any price cannot and will not be accepted,'' Izetbegovic said.
``We will negotiate where we can and make war where we have to. If
the enemy does not show readiness for reasonable political
solutions within the next four months, the cease-fire will not be
extended.''
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement, which grew out of mediation initiated by
former President Jimmy Carter, was widely welcomed as a potential
breakthrough, it contains several major provisions that were
included in previous agreements but never carried out. It remains
to be seen whether they will be taken more seriously this time.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two armies will pull back from battle
lines and allow troops from the U.N. Protection Force, known as
UNPROFOR, to move between them. The agreement says negotiations are
to follow about the exchange of prisoners and other issues,
including procedures ``for the withdrawal and monitoring by
UNPROFOR of heavy weapons of caliber 12.7 mm and above.''
</P>
<P>
The parties also agreed ``to assist fully in the total
restoration of utilities and the establishment of joint economic
activities aimed at the normalization of life in all territories.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
One provision that has been made and broken repeatedly in the
past is a commitment to allow full freedom of movement for U.N.
peacekeepers and for relief convoys. Another guarantees the
security of the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
The agreement contained no reference to the peace plan proposed
by the five-nation ``contact group,'' a glaring omission. Mediators
have been insisting that any final treaty must be based on
acceptance of that plan, but the new agreement suggested that they
were backing away from that demand.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs had said they would not accept the contact group's
plan, so for them the fact that it was not mentioned in the new
agreement represented at least a procedural victory.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi,
who helped guide the mediation that produced the new agreement,
said talks aimed at a comprehensive peace treaty would begin later
this month. He said they would be held under the auspices of the
contact group, which is made up of the United States, France,
Britain, Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
``There have been many cease-fires, but this is the first time
we have a cessation-of-hostilities agreement,'' Akashi said. ``I
hope that we are turning a very important corner in this most
tragic conflict in Europe since the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
But many U.N. officials, including Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose,
the senior U.N. military commander in Bosnia, warned that the
forthcoming talks will be exceedingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
``You can say that the easy part, difficult as it was, is now
over,'' Rose said after the signing. ``The difficult bit now
begins. We have to put on the ground vast numbers of troops in
pursuit of different security-building measures to insure that this
process does not go backward.''
</P>
<P>
The process that led to the new agreement was set in motion last
month by Carter, who mediated a week-long cease-fire that expired
Saturday. The cease-fire seemed to hold throughout most of the
country Sunday, although there were reports of continued fighting
around the northwestern town of Bihac.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat who has closely followed the talks said both sides
appeared to have signed the new agreement at least in part for
tactical reasons.
</P>
<P>
``The Serbs are hoping that it will help them stabilize their
front lines,'' the diplomat said. ``For the government, it is a
chance to regroup and also a chance to open supply routes for
relief convoys. But even if both sides are entering into
negotiations only as a tactic, once you begin that process you
never know what might happen.''

<P>
Watching change come to eastern Germany since
the collapse of communism five years ago is like watching newsreels
of life from the 1950s to the 1990s speed past in fast-forward.
</P>
<P>
Office buildings and construction cranes have sprung up in every
major city. Streets have been torn up for new telephone lines, new
sewers and new power cables, and then torn up again for new cable
television wires.
</P>
<P>
New roads snake steadily out from city centers, drawing suburban
housing developments with them and bringing cars, more cars, and
constant traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Now comes what some think could change the traditional German
urban life style more than anything else yet: American-style
suburban shopping malls, surrounded by vast parking lots with
fast-food outlets and cineplexes. Leipzig has the biggest one in
the country.
</P>
<P>
``We now have the greatest concentration of these shopping
centers in all of Germany,'' said Niels Gormsen, the supervisor of
construction projects in Leipzig. ``We see a danger that too many
could kill off downtown commercial districts, just like in
America.''
</P>
<P>
Gormsen and many other city planners here would like to avoid
the crass commercial strips and decaying urban downtowns as
successfully as they did in most medium-size west German cities
over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
He, like many other civil servants here, came from the west to
replace the communist functionaries who emulated Soviet urban
development models in the old days.
</P>
<P>
But since reunification, commercial development and social
change have come so fast that the city authorities have not had the
time that was granted to them in western Germany to plan their
cities to remain livable and commercially viable at the same time.
</P>
<P>
There, Germans built underground parking garages, pedestrian
zones, and modern streetcar lines so cities and their neighborhoods
could survive the automobile and monster suburban malls.
</P>
<P>
Here, the first thing that happened after capitalism came to
eastern Germany in 1990 was a rush by west German retailers to open
large commercial developments the fastest way they could, on
undeveloped land just outside the crumbling major cities.
</P>
<P>
In the urban area around Leipzig (population 500,000) and Halle
(300,000) alone, they have opened centers with a total floor space
of 215 acres and have permission to build another 62 acres' worth.
City planners have turned down plans for 173 acres more.
</P>
<P>
``What they are building now are bankruptcies in the making,''
said Dr. Ulrich Hatzfeld, an urban expert in Dortmund, who
calculated that nearly half of the shopping centers now being
planned in Germany were in the eastern part of the country, which
has only 20 percent of the population and even less of the total
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all retail shopping space in eastern Germany
is outside the city centers, while in western Germany only 25 to 30
percent is, Hatzfield said. Apart from a few huge malls near
Frankfurt and Cologne, big suburban stores tend to be specialty
shops for furniture, carpeting, or gardening equipment.
</P>
<P>
Even more shopping malls might have developed in eastern Germany
if not for the country's restrictive laws, which require all stores
to close at 6:30 p.m. most weekdays, early afternoon on most
Saturdays, and all day Sunday. Other laws restrict price discounts.
</P>
<P>
``The main danger we see is not to the centers of historic
cities like Leipzig or Dresden, but to neighborhoods on the
periphery,'' Gormsen said. ``It wouldn't be bad, from the city's
point of view, if some of these shopping centers did go bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
Already, it can take more than an hour to drive the 10 miles
from Leipzig to Germany's biggest shopping mall, the Saale Park at
the intersection of Highway 9 and Route 181, financed by a German
savings bank. Two smaller malls have also sprouted along the way.

``Most days, you just sit in a traffic jam to get out here,''
said Gabriele Smetanin, who had come out to the Saale Park to do
her Christmas shopping at the new Peek  Cloppenburg department
store there. ``Actually, their new store downtown has a better
selection,'' Mrs. Smetanin said. ``I came out of habit today, I
suppose, because this one opened first.''
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jaeger, the shopping center manager, said that hurting
downtown Leipzig was the last thing he wanted to do. ``I'm a native
Leipziger,'' he said. ``We get about half of our customers from
Leipzig and Halle, but the rest come from a 50-kilometer radius all
around.'' The distance is equivalent to about 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
Still, that was 80,000 to 100,000 customers on the Saturdays
before Christmas who did their shopping in the 100 shops in the
open-air mall and not in downtown Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
Karstadt AG, a national chain that is planning to open a new
store in Leipzig next year, calculated recently that the new
suburban malls were siphoning off $380 million in annual sales from
downtown Dresden, $255 million from Leipzig, and $240 million from
Chemnitz.
</P>
<P>
What east German shoppers find in new malls like the Saale Park
and the Sachsenpark on the northeast edge of town is the sort of
thing familiar to suburban American shoppers. At Saale Park there
is bland background music, a giant Toys ``R'' Us, a 10-cinema movie
complex, an Ikea furniture store, McDonald's, and acres of parked
cars.
</P>
<P>
``We're bringing customers a variety of choice they never
dreamed of in the communist days,'' Jaeger said, ``and we've
created hundreds of jobs. The villages around here didn't even have
decent plumbing and electric power until we brought it to them with
the mall.''
</P>
<P>
And the customers keep coming. ``We've all been out there,''
said Jutta Richter, who lives in downtown Leipzig. ``I bought a
couple of couches, and if I have to put a new kitchen into our next
apartment, I'll go there again to get it.''
</P>
<P>
But Mrs. Richter said she didn't enjoy the experience, and
prefers to shop in town. The city is also trying to keep commercial
development from driving apartment dwellers from the center of
town, and introducing modern streetcars to provide easy access from
the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
``You can't imagine how overwhelmed we are by all the changes we
have gone through,'' Mrs. Richter said. ``Until five years ago,
there was only one of everything, always at the same price, and the
only question you asked when you went shopping was what the stores
had that particular day. Now it takes me half an hour just to
figure out which detergent is the best buy.''
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Leipzig was an industrially polluted mess, the
late Gothic Thomaskirche where Johann Sebastian Bach spent his most
creative years as choirmaster slowly crumbling and begrimed like
most of the 19th-century commercial buildings around it.
</P>
<P>
Today the church gleams, restored with money from the city and
the state of Saxony. After a western developer, Juergen Schneider,
disappeared early this year to avoid bankruptcy, German banks
financed the completion of a new indoor shopping gallery around
Auerbach's Keller, a tavern that is one of the settings for
Goethe's ``Faust.''
</P>
<P>
The compact city center has so many shops, malls, and office
buildings under construction that picking through the narrow
streets is like running an obstacle course. Peek  Cloppenburg's
store, a dramatic stone-and-glass building designed by a Santa
Monica, Calif., architectural team -- Charles Moore, John Ruble, and
Buzz Yudell -- opened on the main shopping street, the
Petersstrasse, last summer.
</P>
<P>
What Leipzig's downtown doesn't have enough of is parking
spaces. It did not even have parking meters until after communism
collapsed, and the few spaces that exist are inadequate. An
underground garage is only in the planning stages in front of the
modern Gewandhaus, home to the orchestra once directed by Felix
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and now by Kurt Masur, who is also the music
director of the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
``The one sad aspect to all of this is that almost all the
building is for places where west German companies can sell
products made in west Germany to east German consumers,'' said Dr.
Christoph Boeckenfoerde, another city official who came from the
west. ``We're consuming here, not creating -- so far,'' he said.

ADVERTISERS TARGET SELECT GROUP OF CONSUMERS: `WORKPAUSAL WOMEN'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-WORKPAUSAL-WOMEN-MEDIA-600ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Current television commercials for Levi's Jeans for Women show a
Matisse-like stick figure with a shaped hangar as a face balancing
on a seesaw and a silhouette escaping from a confining logo on a
door, trading her dress for jeans and shattering the prison that
encased her.
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign, created by FCB San Francisco, is somewhat
unusual for its surreal style. But what really sets it apart is its
attempt to speak to a statistically small but influential group of
women: the ``workpausals.''
</P>
<P>
While now largely confined to the privileged set, workpausals
represent the front line of an important emerging societal trend.
New evidence suggests that perhaps as a reaction to the careerism
of the 1980's, or because of a nostalgia for a more traditional
life style, many mothers are yearning for a ``time out.'' Some are
actually taking it, becoming full-time mothers for a few years and
then resuming their careers.
</P>
<P>
``Women have stopped apologizing for staying home,'' said Donny
Deutsch, chief executive and executive creative director of Deutsch
Inc. ``Now it's a badge.''
</P>
<P>
Susan Small Weil, a strategist with the Seiden Group, said
today's mother at home is ``a modern-day status symbol, a guiltless
new traditionalist doing the responsible thing.''
</P>
<P>
Television and publishers have recognized this group of women,
portraying strong mothers in TV shows and producing new magazines
like Family Fun. But most marketers have not addressed the group.
</P>
<P>
Advertisers have retired the image of the superwoman, who, as
portrayed in the 1970s Enjoli perfume ads, brought home the bacon
and fried it up in a pan.
</P>
<P>
``Marketers are just now catching on to the fact that people
have stopped glorifying work as the be-all and end-all of life and
that portraying that may not be the way to capture women's
hearts,'' said Maryann Gormley, spokeswoman for Women at Home, a
Virginia-based support group.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Feigin, executive vice president and director of
strategic services at Grey Advertising, said that while shows like
``Roseanne,'' and ``Mad About You'' show women ``in contemporary
ways, the commercials in them do not.''
</P>
<P>
There are a few exceptions, like an ad for Dove soap that
describes its rural protagonist as someone who's ``always known
what works for her,'' which was praised by Woman at Home.
</P>
<P>
Still, Ms. Feigen said, ``Three out of four women think
advertising is out of touch with where they are today.''
</P>
<P>
Sheile Wellington, president of Catalyst, an organization that
deals with women and work issues, said the number of working women
was continuing to rise, adding that ``women, just like men, work
for a paycheck, not for pin money.''
</P>
<P>
But recent surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that
fewer young mothers are working now than in 1987.
</P>
<P>
And Roper Starch Worldwide, a polling organization, says that
while fewer than half of the women surveyed in 1985 wanted to stay
at home, 53 percent of the same number surveyed recently said that
they would like to do so.
</P>
<P>
``Although their actual numbers are small, the power wife-mother
is our latest status symbol, more important than a mink coat,''
said Laurel Cutler, executive vice president and director of
strategic planning at FCB San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Arlene Cardozo, author of ``Sequencing,'' believes the time-out
trend is already widespread. ``What started with trailblazers,
professional doctors and lawyers' wives and women with wealthy
husbands is rapidly becoming a well-worn highway with wives of
garage mechanics and factory workers extending maternity leaves to
a few years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone agrees that advertising is not yet zeroing in
on these women. But a change in buying habits is already apparent.
``It's a shift from more money, less time, to less money, more
time,'' said Ms. Weil of the Seiden Group. ``There's less `one-stop
shop' and more searching for the better deal. They're ordering in
and picking up prepared foods less, and heading to the library
instead of the bookstore more.''
</P>
<P>
One obvious result is that sales of women's business suits are
down and those of casual clothes are up. The Kayser-Roth Corp., a
leading maker of women's hosiery, has reported that a decade ago
sheer hosiery accounted for 85 percent of the $4.2 billion leg-wear
market, compared with 67 percent late last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of socks, meanwhile, jumped from 13 percent to 23 percent
during the same period
</P>
<P>
``We recognize this as the age of the power woman,'' said Patti
Cohen, advertising director for Donna Karan Inc., the clothing
retailer. ``But power no longer means workaholism,'' Ms. Cohen
said, adding that DKNY casual weekend wear was Donna Karan's
strongest division.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Advertisers are seeking neutral terrain -- outdoor scenes are a
good example -- so that their campaigns are directed at all women.
The trend is away from either-or images and toward those depicting
a balance of career and home, said Ignazio Puccio, senior vice
president and executive director of strategic planning at J. Walter
Thompson New York.
</P>
<P>
Many marketers now shy away from at-home scenes, ``for fear it
will play to a previous stereotype,'' Ms. Small Weil said.
``Today's housewife is not a scrubber. She's more relaxed about
housework because she's not home for that.''
</P>
<P>
Ms. Cutler of FCB said: ``Marketing to their deep mothering
instinct is marketing to them the old-fashioned way. A better
language would be the universal one of business with overlays of
caring, nurturing, gentleness, femininity and sexiness.''
</P>
<P>
``The ads that strike a chord with workpausals acknowledge
they're at peace with themselves,'' said Marian Salzman, president
of BKG America, a market research company in New York. She cited a
Keds spot where a 30-ish mom does laundry accompanied by her trusty
golden retriever while talking about things that are comfortable.
</P>
<P>
``It's reinforcement advertising that says you're still
attractive and you can get back on the ladder,'' Ms. Salzman said.
``The operative word is choice. What their mothers saw as making
sacrifices, they see as a chosen way of life.''

RADIO INDUSTRY HAS BANNER YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-RADIO-MEDIA-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the oldest broadcasting medium, 1994 was a very good year.
</P>
<P>
Advertising revived with a vengeance, posting double-digit
increases in 7 of the first 10 months of the year and ending the
first 10 months up 12 percent over all.
</P>
<P>
In the face of this growing demand, the industry was able to
raise its rates after several years of marking them down to gain
business. Radio executives are optimistic that strong increases
will be posted in 1995 as well.
</P>
<P>
As industry ownership continued to consolidate, the biggest got
bigger, taking advantage of rules revisions adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission in 1992.
</P>
<P>
One owner may now operate 20 AM and 20 FM stations and even
though twice as many stations are on the air as a decade ago, the
number of station owners remains the same. More deals are now in
the works, so the consolidation will surely continue in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Infinity Broadcasting Corp. of New York, for example, added
four stations in 1994, giving it 16 FM and 10 AM stations, and
gained control of the large Westwood One radio network. The other
big radio companies -- CBS; Westinghouse Broadcasting, also known as
Group W, a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric, and Capital
Cities/ABC -- either added stations, swapped smaller ones for larger
ones, sharply increased revenue or all three.
</P>
<P>
The other growth spurt came in talk radio, which soared in
numbers and in influence, as well -- a trend that was made clear by
the many political candidates tripping over each other as they
tried to get on the air before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
Radio stations carrying nothing but news, talk, business
coverage or sports, or, in other words, no music, grew to 1,028 in
1994 from 841 in 1993, compared with only 308 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
And the Big Three of talk radio, Howard Stern, Don Imus and Rush
Limbaugh, continued to increase the number of stations carrying
their syndicated programs.
</P>
<P>
The radio industry scored another victory in 1994 when the FCC
looked Stern in the eye, recoiled in disgust at what it called his
indecent programming, but then slunk away, concluding that it
lacked the power to penalize Infinity, Stern's employer, in any
meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
The commission had discussed blocking Infinity's plan to pay
$170 million to acquire three stations, or even rescinding some
Infinity licenses, but it decided in February that a federal
appeals court decision had eroded its power to do so. (More than $1
million in fines that the commission has levied against Infinity
for Stern's on-air remarks continue to be appealed in the courts.)
</P>
<P>
Infinity's chairman, Mel Karmazin, continued to consolidate his
position as radio's most influential executive.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the huge New York audience and the
enthusiasm of Imus and Stern for insulting each other, he continued
his unusual strategy of having his two stations compete against
each other in the morning ``drive time'' -- radio's prime time. And
the strategy seems to work, for WXRK-FM, Stern's home, runs well
ahead of the competiton as the area's top-rated station, while
WFAN-AM, home to ``Imus in the Morning,'' ties for No. 5.
</P>
<P>
Another Karmazin strategy that has caught the eye of industry
executives is his attempt to establish FM radio, traditionally the
bastion of music, as a home for sports broadcasting. Infinity
carries Dallas Cowboys games on KVIL-FM, Dallas; the Eagles on
WYSP-FM, Philadelphia, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on WQYK-FM,
Tampa. Next season, its WBCN-FM, Boston, will carry the New England
Patriots games. If those bets pay off, imitators will surely
follow.

BIG SALES FOR RECORD INDUSTRY, BUT TURMOIL SPREADS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-MUSIC-TURMOIL-MEDIA-3TAKES-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The record industry closed its books last week on a year of
considerable prosperity, but also one of significant turmoil. It
was a year of upheaval in the executive ranks, and the impact of
these changes is expected to ripple through the industry this year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of recorded music in the United States are expected to
reach a new high of $11 billion in 1994, up 10 percent from 1993.
And optimism remains high for this year, when many big-name
releases are planned. But who will be where, taking credit for
what, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The face of the industry has changed during the last few years.
The old guard of powerful entrepreneurs, most of them at least two
generations older than the audience they were making records for,
has been replaced by a crop of creative baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
Many of the newcomers rose through the ranks by grasping hold of
new music, like alternative rock and hip-hop, and bringing it into
the corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
The center of much of the turmoil last year was the Warner Music
Group, a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., which accounts for about
21 percent of the market in recorded music through its Atlantic,
Elektra and Warner Brothers labels.
</P>
<P>
During the summer and fall, a number of longtime Warner Music
executives left the company after they lost an internal power
struggle.
</P>
<P>
These executives may start or join other companies, while the
people who replaced them are likely to revamp their labels and in
the process the industry itself.
</P>
<P>
Warner Music was not the only company that experienced unrest.
The Polygram Label Group, which included the Island, Polydor and
London labels, disbanded in June, and BMG, which includes Arista,
RCA and Jive records, just ended its joint venture with Imago
records after having lost tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the industry's No. 2 company, Sony Music, whose
Columbia, Epic and other labels account for 13 percent of the U.S.
market, had a calm and prosperous 1994, despite the enormous
problems its parent company ran into with its Hollywood film
studios.
</P>
<P>
What follows are snapshots of the movers and shakers to watch in
1995. Some are familiar faces at new posts, others are fresh faces
thrust up by the growth of alternative rock and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
MICHELE ANTHONY, 38, executive vice president, Sony Music
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Before joining Sony in 1990, Ms. Anthony worked as a lawyer for
artists like Guns `n' Roses, Soundgarden and the Pixies. She
distinguished herself as a vice president at Sony Music by securing
deals with Pearl Jam and Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
In January, Ms. Anthony was promoted to second-in-command of
Sony's music division, behind Tommy Mottola. Ms. Anthony is
considered to be a sharp, hands-on executive whom artists respect.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: In the short term, her mandate is to deal with the
quirks of the company's cash cow, Pearl Jam. Long term, she needs
to attract new talent.
</P>
<P>
JEFF AYEROFF, 47, JORDAN HARRIS, 41, co-presidents of an
as-yet-unnamed Sony label.
</P>
<P>
They began their careers at AM Records in the 1970s and
co-founded Virgin Records America in 1986. When they left Virgin 15
months ago, they were expected to take top positions at Warner
Music, but the shake-up left them in limbo.
</P>
<P>
Sony grabbed them to establish a strong West Coast presence.
Columbia, a Sony label, plans to fold the roster of its Chaos label
plus some bands of its own into the pair's new label, which will
open for business in January.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: It is too early to predict the future of the label, but
rival executives are taking it seriously.
</P>
<P>
KEN BERRY, 42, chief executive, EMI Records Group and Virgin
Music Group.
</P>
<P>
Berry, who has been at Virgin in England for 21 years, has
proved himself in recent years by keeping Thorn EMI's $900 million
purchase of Virgin from seeming like a folly. Better known as a
money man than as a music man, he made Virgin a force in the United
States by appointing as its president Phil Quartararo, who has
helped make it EMI's most profitable label here. But EMI remains a
troubled company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: Berry seems to be a likely candidate to lead the
inevitable restructuring of EMI in the United States.
</P>
<P>
DAVID GEFFEN, 51, founder, David Geffen Co.
</P>
<P>
Since Geffen built his first label, Asylum, at the age of 27, he
has been a formidable if unpredictable force in the industry. He
started Geffen Records in 1980 and sold it 10 years later to MCA
for $545 million in preferred stock. With artists like Nirvana,
Counting Crows and Guns `n' Roses, Geffen and its sister label,
DGC, have built up an impressive roster.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: Geffen's contract with MCA will expire on April 1 and he
has said he will start a record company with his new business
partners, the director Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the
former Disney executive. Some insiders expect him to abandon his
namesake label and start a company with executives who defected
from Warner Brothers. Others think he will try to to buy out MCA,
and thus Geffen Records.

<P>
GARY GERSH, 38, president and chief executive, Capitol Records.
</P>
<P>
An ace talent scout at Geffen Records, where he brought in Sonic
Youth, Counting Crows and Nirvana. EMI decided to put Gersh in
charge of Capitol, its sinking flagship label, 16 months ago. Gersh
trimmed the label's roster to 27 artists from 90, replaced more
than half its executives and made deals with top producers like
Daniel Lanois and Brad Wood.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: Music industry analysts are waiting to see whether Gersh
can change Capitol from an oldies label living off its catalogue
(the Beach Boys, the Beatles and others) into a competitor in
hip-hop, rhythm and blues and alternative rock.
</P>
<P>
DANNY GOLDBERG, 44, chief executive and chairman, Warner
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Goldberg was managing the skyrocketing careers
of Nirvana, Bonnie Raitt and others. Brought into Atlantic Records
as a senior vice president in 1992, he has quickly scaled the
corporate ladder, driven by good instincts and alternative-music
savvy. He brought the respected independent labels Matador, Mammoth
and Curb into the Atlantic fold and has a reputation as an
executive whom artists can trust.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: With his promotion Jan. 1 to head of Warner Brothers, he
must ease tactfully into many of the responsibilities that the
widely respected Mo Ostin (who quit during the Warner shake-up) had
for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
BRETT GUREWITZ, 32, president and owner, Epitaph Records.
</P>
<P>
Gurewitz surprised the music industry this year when an album he
released by the punk-rock group Offspring became the most
successful rock record released by an independent label in years.
Though every major record label has offered Gurewitz substantial
sums for all or a piece of Epitaph, he insists he wants to continue
as an independent.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: Will his bands stand by him, or yield to offers from
major labels?
</P>
<P>
DON IENNER, 42, chairman, Columbia Records Group.
</P>
<P>
Ienner helped rebuild Arista Records in the 1980s with artists
like Whitney Houston, Kenny G. and Expose. Five years ago he was
brought by Sony to Columbia Records, the industry's fallen leader,
to do the same. Columbia says its profits have doubled since then
because of Ienner, a confident and forceful executive. But this
year Columbia had relatively few big hits and is beginning to be
eclipsed by its sister label, Epic. 
FUTURE: With new albums expected from Bruce Springsteen, Alice in
Chains, Soul Asylum, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan and Michael Bolton, next
year could be a big one for Columbia. Ienner's challenge is to
change the label's reputation as a home for adult contemporary
musicians and dinosaur rockers, and make it into a breeding ground
for younger, hipper artists.
</P>
<P>
JIMMY IOVINE, 41, TED FIELD, 42, co-presidents and co-owners,
Interscope Records.
</P>
<P>
By taking risks on gangster rap and industrial rock, Iovine, a
producer, has created one of the highest-profile companies in the
business, with the financial backing of Field. Through costly deals
with Nine Inch Nails, Helmet and Tupac Shakur, and with the Death
Row rap label, they built up the net worth of Interscope --
currently a joint venture with Atlantic Records -- to what they say
is $300 million.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: Warner Music wants to take over Interscope and position
it as its fourth major label; Iovine and Field say they will not
sell. Next year, it will become clear if they will crack, and for
how much, and whether Interscope has enough successful acts to live
up to its reputation.
</P>
<P>
SUGE KNIGHT, 29, DR. DRE, 29, co-owners, Death Row Records.
</P>
<P>
Knight and the rapper and producer Dr. Dre are one of the most
successful business and creative teams in hip-hop. Between the
record label and Suge Knight Management, whose singers include Mary
J. Blige and Jodeci, they have taken in more than $75 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
But since starting Death Row, Knight has been convicted for
weapons violations and charged with racketeering. Next month he
will be back in court fighting another weapons violation charge and
a charge that he assaulted two rappers.
</P>

DOUG MORRIS, 55, chairman and chief operating officer, Warner
Music U.S.
</P>
<P>
A cunning strategist and a master of expansion, Morris helped
Atlantic transform itself in four years from a has-been to the top
label in the industry. His ascent signaled the changing of the
guard in the music business. Morris has surrounded himself with a
strong, young and loyal team of executives.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: His biggest challenge is to keep the boat he rocked
steady, a feat he took a step toward recently when he settled a
contract dispute with Metallica and prevented the band from leaving
Elektra after the departure of the label's head, Robert Krasnow.
</P>
<P>
SYLVIA RHONE, 42, chairman, Elektra/EastWest Records.
</P>
<P>
It took 18 years for Ms. Rhone to climb from secretary to the
most powerful woman in the recording business. When she was
promoted from chairman and chief executive of East/West Records to
her new job in July, East/West was merged with Elektra and Asylum
records.
</P>
<P>
Best known for developing rap and rhythm-and-blues acts like
Snow, En Vogue, and Das EFX, one of her first big moves at Elektra
was to help with the acquisition of 49 percent of the Seattle rock
label Sub Pop, which began the careers of Nirvana and Soundgarden.
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: If, as expected, Sire Records becomes part of Elektra,
can Ms. Rhone lift her division of Warner Music to equal stature
with Atlantic and Warner Brothers?
</P>
<P>
OTHER PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
Val Azzoli was appointed president of Atlantic Records last
month, as the label's top executives and labels were being
redistributed by Warner Music Group. Now he must rebuild it. Chris
Blackwell, the chairman of Island records, extended his contract
with Polygram in December and is starting to play a much more
active role at the label. Clive Calder, the self-effacing
entrepreneur who runs Jive Records, had one of his strongest years
in 1994 thanks to rhythm-and-blues artists like R. Kelly and
Aaliyah. Clive Davis is just about the only old-school executive
still running a label. Despites its small size, his Arista Records
had an incredible year, becoming the No. 3 label of 1994 with with
blockbuster acts like Kenny G., Ace of Base and Toni Braxton. Tim
DuBois of Arista and Tony Brown at MCA were two of the most
successful and sought-after executives in Nashville last year.
Robert Krasnow left his position as head of Elektra when he found
out he would have to report to Doug Morris. MCA wooed him with $3
million for a start-up label. Jim Gueirnot, manager of the
punk-rock band Offspring, was given what is said to be more than
$30 million to start an Arista-distributed label from scratch.
Jonathan Poneman, a co-owner of Seattle's Sub Pop records, proved
his worth by nurturing a good local music scene. Even after Seattle
was almost picked dry by major labels, Warner Music gave him
millions to spend and invest. Davitt Sigerson, stepped down as
president of Polydor records during the shake-up at Polygram, must
now try to salvage EMI records as its new chief executive. Tom
Silverman, chairman and founder of Warner Brothers' Tommy Boy
label, has an agreement with Warner that expires at the end of
March. If negotiations don't work out, he said, he'll start a new
label. And RCA Records is still looking for a president, if anyone
is interested.

THE INVENTORS OF A OIL FILTER FOR BOATS HAVE TROUBLE ATTRACTING A MANUFACTURER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON  (BC-PATENTS-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the first things independent inventors learn
is that the phrase ``if you build it, they will come'' does not
usually apply to manufacturing. Many inventors are stunned to
discover that their low-tech, common-sense inventions do not
inspire companies to retool factories to change the product's
long-standing design.
</P>
<P>
Michael and Dorothy Kucik have hit that section of the
inventors' learning curve. The Kuciks run a heavy-machinery rigging
company in Baltimore and are avid boaters in their spare time. For
years they struggled with the mess and water pollution caused by
the changing of their boat's oil filter.
</P>
<P>
Finally, rather than continue using filters that always retained
a bit of oil, the Kuciks designed and patented one with an extra
valve so the residual oil can be drained before the filter is
removed.
</P>
<P>
But Kucik says the manufacturers who every year produce 400
million disposable oil filters for cars and boats are not
interested in his invention.
</P>
<P>
``The filter companies don't want to buy our invention because
they're already selling filters now and they don't think this is
necessary,'' said Kucik, who said he had pitched his patent to many
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
``We invented this strictly from an environmental point of
view,'' he continued. Though boat owners are allowed to pump
biodegradable wastes into water, many inadvertently add engine oil
to the mix because they spill it. When oil is changed on a boat,
the crankcase is drained and the filter is unscrewed. The problem:
the filter contains about a quart of residual oil under pressure,
which then overflows.
</P>
<P>
``One quart of oil can pollute a million gallons of water,''
Kucik said. Used motor oil and filters are considered hazardous
waste in many places, and spills can be costly to boaters: the
Coast Guard fines polluters up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
``We always tried to do it with plastic bags to catch the oil,''
Dorothy Kucik said, ``but it's difficult because of the cramped
quarters in a boat engine and because once the oil spills, the
plastic bag sticks to the oil.''
</P>
<P>
The Kucik's filter has an extra valve extending from the bottom.
A hose can be attached, or if there's room, a container can be
placed under the valve to catch the residual oil.
</P>
<P>
``The valve can't vibrate open while the boat is in use,'' Kucik
said. ``You have to give it a half turn with a pair of pliers.''
</P>
<P>
The Kuciks have put together a fact sheet about their filter and
say they are not discouraged by the failure so far to license their
invention.
</P>
<P>
``The Coast Guard loved the idea, so we're going to get it on
the market if we have to manufacture it ourselves,'' Kucik said.
The Kuciks won patent 5,366,400.
</P>
<P>
For those who spend their leisure time on land, Raymond and
Hilde Smith have invented a two-story recreational vehicle. But
they don't raise a roof or expand accordion walls over the first
floor. Instead, they slide a fixed second floor down into the first
level.
</P>
<P>
In the Smiths' design, the first floor has two bedrooms and a
bathroom. In storage or travel mode, the ceiling lowers to about
bed level. That same ceiling is also the floor of the second story
-- which has a living room, kitchen and dining room, complete with
furniture that never needs to be moved.
</P>
<P>
``As you lower the second floor, it goes down until it rests on
stops or on the furniture of the first floor,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
When camping, a three-ton hoist driven by an electric motor
lifts the second floor until enough room is created underneath to
create the first floor.
</P>
<P>
``The second floor is raised by 12 to 14 cables which are
attached to take-up drums and the electric hoist motor,'' said
Smith, a retired design engineer from North Tonawanda, N.Y. ``When
it gets all the way up, its locked into place so the weight is no
longer on the cables.''
</P>
<P>
In storage mode, the camper is 10 feet 10 inches tall. When the
second floor is elevated, it measures nearly 17 feet. The vehicle
is stabilized by four legs that extend outside from the front and
back of each side and are planted firmly on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A small elevator shaft is created between the two floors and
directly in front of the camper's side entrance door.
</P>
<P>
Smith said his design could be adapted for trailers, motor homes
or recreational vehicles. It received patent 5,374,094.
</P>
<P>
Ted Schott, a Minnesota game inventor, has a suggestion for
dealing with pent-up energy: a good pillow fight. But his version
has characters named Harry Hitman and Swingin' Sam, an electronic
timer, a helmet and knee pads.
</P>
<P>
Schott has patented what he calls a ``stress-reducing'' board
game for two to six players. Each person chooses a colored token
and spins a dial to move along a serpentine path.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a player's token may land on neutral squares or
on a spot instructing the player to stop for a pillow fight. The
timer limits the length of the pummeling, and the game comes with
soft pillows, the helmet and elbow and knee pads.
</P>
<P>
Each player is pummeled by other players as he or she reaches
the end of the path, marked ``bedtime.'' The last person to land at
bedtime wins the game.
</P>
<P>
Schott received patent 5,362,062.
</P>
<P>
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

TESTAVERDE LEADS BROWNS TO 20-13 WIN OVER PATS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEVELAND  (BC-FBN-BROWNS-PATRIOTS-400ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Testaverde of Elmont, N.Y., was in Cleveland to
lend his son, Vinny, some moral support in his first playoff game.
But he didn't attend the game against the Patriots at Cleveland
Stadium Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde doesn't know where his father spent the time
during the game. He speculates that his father spent part of the
day at church, no doubt offering up a prayer on behalf of his son
and the Cleveland Browns. Testaverde thinks his father might have
gone to a Cleveland mall to do some shopping.
</P>
<P>
``He has a little bit of a heart condition and he can't get too
excited, can't get his blood pressure up,'' Testaverde said. ``We
talked before the season and he told me that he wasn't going to
come to the stadium for any of my games. But we made a deal that if
I made it to the Super Bowl, he'd come.''
</P>
<P>
If Vinny Testaverde plays in his next two playoff games the way
he played against the Patriots Sunday afternoon, then it's a date.
</P>
<P>
In a game fraught with potential pitfalls, Testaverde was
masterly in guiding the Browns past all the trouble spots and to a
20-13 victory over New England, a team that had finished the
regular season with seven straight triumphs.
</P>
<P>
The Browns, making their first playoff appearance since 1989,
will play at Pittsburgh next Saturday. It's the third game between
the American Football Conference Central rivals this season, the
Browns having lost the first two to the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
``We're not looking at it like it's the third game against
them,'' said Browns linebacker Pepper Johnson. ``We're going to
approach it like it's the first game against them and like they're
standing in the way of us getting the AFC championship.''
</P>
<P>
If Testaverde plays as well as he did Sunday, the Browns have an
excellent shot.
</P>
<P>
The knock against Testaverde, who played six seasons at Tampa
Bay, is that he isn't a big-time quarterback capable of leading a
team through the playoffs because he makes crucial mistakes at the
most inopportune times. In Cleveland his detractors detest him
simply because he's not Bernie Kosar, the local favorite who was
booted out of Cleveland last year by Browns Coach Bill Belichick to
make room for Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
``People have always talked bad about Vinny, about the things
that he can't do,'' said Browns left tackle Tony Jones. ``He showed
today what he can do. He's a confident quarterback. He's very
mobile and he has a strong arm. He came out of the pocket and moved
around. He made a lot of plays on his own today. He showed up and
showed everybody what he's capable of.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Testaverde completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards and a
touchdown and threw 7 passes to receiver Michael Jackson for 122
yards. Eleven of his completions were for first downs. In the third
quarter, Testaverde was 7 of 7 for 80 yards and the Browns held the
ball for 11 minutes 21 seconds of the period.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, when Cleveland was trailing by 7-3,
Testaverde picked up 14 yards on back-to-back scrambles to keep
Cleveland's first touchdown drive going. He capped the drive with a
5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Carrier, a former teammate
at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
``I knew before the game that he was ready to play,'' Carrier
said. ``He threw me a couple of passes in the pregame and he was
really pumped up. He was so pumped up I think he might have had to
take some oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
Testaverde settled down nicely in time for the game. Other than
working from the game plan, Testaverde said he entered the game
with a simple strategy.
</P>
<P>
``On every play I tried to make something happen,'' he said. ``I
didn't want to make any plays where we had negative yardage. If it
meant I had to scramble, I'd scramble. If it meant I had to throw
the ball away, I threw it away. This is the playoffs and every play
is important. If you lose, you go home.''
</P>
<P>
Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots' second-year quarterback who was also
making his first playoff apppearance, learned that hard lesson.
Bledsoe's 50 pass attempts were the most against the Browns this
year and the most against Cleveland in the playoffs. But he
completed just 21 of them and threw 3 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure and looking at a variety of blitz packages
and zone and man coverages in various disguises, Bledsoe was never
able to get into a passing rhythm. When the Patriots were trailing
by 17-10 early in the fourth quarter, Bledsoe threw interceptions
on successive drives to kill scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
``We knew if we kept hitting him we could rattle him,'' said
Browns defensive end Rob Burnett. ``He started talking to the refs
after a while, saying we were hitting him late. You know when the
quarterback starts to talk to the refs, then he doesn't have his
mind on what he's supposed to be doing. We knew we were getting to
him.''
</P>
<P>
The Patriots were tied with the Browns at 10-10 late in the
third quarter. Then Testaverde completed all four passes on a
79-yard drive capped by Leroy Hoard's 10-yard scoring run, putting
the Browns ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe had one final chance to tie the game after the Patriots
kicked a field goal, then recovered an onside kick at their 36 with
1:28 to play. But after getting one first down, he threw four
straight incompletions from his 48.
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Bill Parcells decided to keep the power
running back Marion Butts on the bench and go with Corey Croom, who
hadn't started a game this season and had started just one last
year. It was a curious decision, which Parcells chalked up to
wanting to get ``a little change'' in the offense. It didn't pay
off.
</P>
<P>
``Butts isn't one of those backs who has 50 or more catches this
year,'' Burnett said. ``I think they did it because they wanted
backs in the game who could catch the ball. They came in here
thinking that Bledsoe could beat us. He couldn't.''

NEW STOCK AND BOND ISSUES FELL BY ALMOST 33 PERCENT IN 1994
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-UNDERWRITING-ART-595ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a strong start, 1994 limped to a disappointing
close for Wall Street's underwriters.
</P>
<P>
New issues of stocks and bonds totaled $709 billion for the
year, down nearly 33 percent from 1993's record of more than $1
trillion and the lowest total since 1991, according to Securities
Data Co.
</P>
<P>
The large decline in underwriting volume is the best
illustration of the difficulties that plagued the securities
industry last year, its most trying since the downturn of the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Underwriting new stocks and bonds is one of the industry's most
lucrative businesses. In 1994 the total underwriting fees disclosed
by Wall Street companies plunged more than 39 percent from 1993,
according to Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
But not all the news was bad for Wall Street in 1994. Mergers
and takeover activity reached a record $339.4 billion, surpassing
the previous record of $335.8 billion set in 1988, according to
Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the highly speculative takeovers typical of the
merger boom of the 1980s, the 1994 deals were dominated by
corporations making strategic moves to increase their reach in
industries like telecommunications, health care, pharmaceuticals,
financial services and high technology.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and investment bankers expect the merger trend to
continue this year, as a weak dollar and relatively strong stock
market make deals attractive. And as buyers look beyond banks to
finance their deals, the trend could also help to lift the junk
bond market.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in underwriting volume shows how swiftly Wall
Street's fortunes can decline. The year began strongly, as the
industry continued to ride a four-year boom that had seen steady
declines in interest rates. With rates at a record low in 1993 and
stock prices strong, many corporations took the opportunity to
raise cash by issuing stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
When the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates
in February, the issuing of debt became more expensive. At the same
time, the strong economy lifted revenue for many companies,
diminishing their need to tap the markets for capital.
</P>
<P>
``Most companies had pre-funded a lot of their debt needs for
the next year or two in 1993,'' said Seth Waugh, managing director
of global debt financing at Merrill Lynch  Co., which was the
industry's leading underwriter in 1994 for the seventh consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
As the Fed continued to raise rates in each quarter, the volume
of new bond issues declined. The $117 billion raised from new
issues in the fourth quarter was nearly 60 percent lower than the
amount raised in the first quarter. It was also the lowest
quarterly total since the end of 1990, according to Securities
Data.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the underwriting of mortgage-backed securities slid the
furthest last year, falling 57 percent, as the climb in interest
rates ended a boom in home-mortgage refinancing. Junk-bond
underwriting fell nearly 39 percent, followed by investment-grade
debt, whose underwriting fell 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rising rates also took their toll on the underwriting of
stocks. Though the business remained relatively strong in the first
half of the year, it fell off quickly as investors began to worry
that the rising returns offered by bonds would divert funds from
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
``By the third quarter, the environment was very difficult on
the new-issues side,'' said Tom Davis, head of equity capital
markets at Merrill Lynch. The number of new issues dried up as
companies postponed or canceled offerings.
</P>
<P>
Though the stock markets have remained relatively strong, the
equity underwriting business has stayed weak. ``While the flow of
funds into equities has slowed, it has not reversed,'' Davis said.
``The concern is still out there, but the reality hasn't
materialized yet.''
</P>
<P>
As domestic new issues dried up, a larger portion of new issues
of both debt and equity in the second half of 1994 were foreign.
That is a trend that Merrill Lynch expects to continue this year.
</P>
<P>
``Foreigners didn't really take advantage of lower rates,''
Waugh said. Emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern
Europe are in a building phase, and if they are looking for
long-term debt, they have little choice but to tap the American
capital markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
But James Bianco, director of research at the Arbor Trading
Group in Barrington, Ill., said domestic debt issuers were scarce
because they were getting better deals from banks.
</P>
<P>
``Wall Street has a problem,'' he said. ``It is pushing a
product that is not very attractive in the current environment.''
</P>
<P>
That is because, with short-term lending rates high, banks can
raise cash from depositors relatively cheaply. Meanwhile, Wall
Street companies have been forced to pay higher short-term rates to
finance their underwritings. And the banks are making loans at
relatively high medium-term rates.
</P>
<P>
The banks also helped fuel the record number of deals in 1994.
``The level of interest rates is not as key as the availability of
funds,'' said Eric Gleacher, an investment banker who specializes
in mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Gleacher and other merger specialists say that the number of
deals will remain high next year as industries continue to
consolidate.
</P>
<P>
``I think you are going to see more activity from European
companies next year,'' he said, ``because the European economy is
coming back and the dollar is very weak.''

A MILLION-DOLLAR FIGHT OVER 100 ACRES OF SCRUB OAK AND MARSH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SUNSET BEACH, N.C.  (BC-CAROLINA-ISLAND-ART-580ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One bright autumn day a few dozen people
waded across a shallow inlet to Bird Island, one of the last
privately owned, undeveloped islands on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
Surf broke gently at their feet. Small dunes rose behind them,
backed by the twisted pines and scrub oak of the island's tiny
maritime forest. On the far side of the narrow island, yellow-green
marsh grass shimmered in the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
One person stood apart from the others, silent. He was Rees
Poag; his mother, Jane Price Poag, owns the island and he is
seeking permission to develop it.
</P>
<P>
``I am the Devil,'' he had said earlier as he sat by himself at
a lunch sponsored by the Bird Island Preservation Society, which
led the trip and whose name sums up its mission. ``These people
think of me as the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
He and his mother have not said exactly what they would want to
build on Bird Island. And even the most ardent advocates of
preserving it say they should be compensated if they are barred
from building.
</P>
<P>
The question is, How much?
</P>
<P>
As real estate goes, Bird Island does not amount to much. Most
of the 1,100-plus acres are underwater at high tide; only about 100
acres are high and dry, and only about 30 or 40 of them are
developable. And since a wooden bridge burned about 20 years ago,
the only access is by boat, or by bare feet across a meandering
inlet at low tide.
</P>
<P>
But Bird Island lies about halfway between the rapid growth of
Wilmington, N.C., and the throbbing resort towns of Myrtle Beach
and the Grand Strand of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Poag's first husband bought the whole thing for less than
$7,000 30 years ago, and today assessors in Sunset Beach, the town
in which most of the island lies, value it at about $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
State officials and environmentalists reckon that North Carolina
would probably be willing to pay that much for it. But if there
were a bridge, the arithmetic could suddenly change; the 30 or 40
buildable acres might bring $350-500,000 each, for a total of $10
million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Poag says he would like to build a bridge.
</P>
<P>
``I see it as a very desirable piece of property,'' Poag said.
``This property sits at the terminus of the projected I-73 coming
out from the Midwest. You have explosive growth just down the coast
from here. There's not much undeveloped coast.''
</P>
<P>
There are some among the preservation group who maintain that
the Poag family has no intention of doing any development. The
family, which is seeking a bridge permit, this theory goes, is
doing so only to jack up the price the state must eventually pay
for the island.
</P>
<P>
Poag denied that charge. And he noted, with more than a tinge of
irritation in his voice, that the bridge would begin and end on his
family's property and would be built entirely with family money.
</P>
<P>
``You have to be concerned a little bit about property rights,''
he said. ``There are a lot of people who act as if this property
were their own.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
 One of them, in a sense, is Frank Nesmith (NEE-smith), a sturdy,
white-haired man who has been fishing on or near the island for 45
years and who now lives on the mainland nearby.
</P>
<P>
Members of the preservation society call Nesmith the island's
keeper and he estimates that he has led several thousand people
from all over the United States on informal island nature walks,
including the group that Poag joined.
</P>
<P>
Nesmith, who advertises the walks with handmade signs he posts
in Sunset Beach, charges participants nothing. Since the dispute
over the island's future has heated up, however, he has ended his
talks with ``a commercial,'' an appeal for donations to the
society.
</P>
<P>
Though he loves the entire island, its marsh grips his heart.
``As pretty as Grand Canyon,'' he said, gazing out across the water
and grass. ``I don't know why it is so pretty to me, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
Because of the dispute over the island's future, Nesmith said,
he keeps his groups to ``the wet beach,'' the area between the low
and high tide lines that is in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
As the dispute drags on, bitterness on all sides grows.
</P>
<P>
Poag is irritated by the people who troop onto his island, even
if they stay on the wet beach. Members of the society are angry
with Poag.
</P>
<P>
But some, like Todd Miller of the North Carolina Coastal
Federation, a conservation group, save their irritation for the
state. They say officials are needlessly prolonging the a decision
on the application to build a bridge, which they say is certain to
end in denial.
</P>
<P>
But the process, and its attendant studies and fees, could cost
the Poags hundreds of thousands of dollars, money they will
ultimately want to recoup.
</P>
<P>
The seemingly endless review process continues. The Coast Guard
said at the end of December that it had reversed an earlier
decision and would allow the Poags to submit a relatively modest
environmental assessment, rather than an elaborate environmental
impact statement, on the effects a bridge would have on the inlet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coastal federation plans to ask the state Coastal
Resources Commission to rule on whether state regulations would
permit a bridge over the inlet.
</P>
<P>
``The decision is going to be pretty telling,'' Miller said.
``From the perspective of the public, it's an easy case to deal
with. There is massive public support to see that the island is
protected. If the state can't deliver on Bird Island, there is
little hope it can deal effectively with more complicated issues.''

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the public schools are in decline and
that one major reason for poor student performance is the
disintegration of families. But a recent study by the Rand
Corporation suggests just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Student performance has actually improved over the last two
decades, especially among minorities, thanks largely to changes
within families. This startling evaluation deserves careful
examination by politicians and Washington officials before they
indiscriminately dismantle social programs that may actually have
worked.
</P>
<P>
As households with working dads and stay-at-home moms became an
increasingly smaller proportion of American families, social
policy-makers worried about the effects of divorce, illegitimacy
and working mothers on student achievement. But the Rand study
found that factors like parental education, household income,
family size and the age of the mother when the child was born are
more important than family structure.
</P>
<P>
The Rand researchers looked at the results of standardized math
and verbal tests -- known as the National Assessment of Educational
Progress -- taken by youths aged 13 to 18 in the 1970s compared to
the same age group in the 1990s. The scores went up an average of 3
percentile points for white students, 11 points for Hispanic
students and 19 points for black students.
</P>
<P>
These tests, administered to a broad range of students, were
considered better barometers of school performance than the
scholastic aptitude tests, which exclude the non-college-bound
students who made the greatest gains in recent decades and whose
results can be skewed by changes in the mix of students going on to
college.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the biggest family factors
contributing to higher scores on the assessment tests were a drop
in family size, freeing more resources for each child, and a rise
in parental education levels. Those positive influences were
tempered somewhat by an increase in births to younger mothers and
an increase in the number of poor, single-parent families.
</P>
<P>
As the debate over public spending heats up in Washington, these
findings could buttress the argument for more, not less, help for
poor families and poor young mothers. The Rand researchers suggest
that academic gains made in the last 20 years by minority students
can be attributed in large part to public policies promoting equal
educational opportunity and increased investment in children,
families and schools.
</P>
<P>
The Rand study reinforces the notion that children benefit from
being in healthy families. But it also makes an indirect case for
selected and targeted government programs that promote the academic
growth of children and their parents.

EDITORIAL: BIPARTISAN FOREIGN POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-EDIT-FOREIGN-POLICY-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
In the new year, President Clinton confronts a new foreign
policy reality -- a Republican Congress. Republicans are less united
on international issues than on their domestic agenda. But critics
of specific administration policies now lead both houses and chair
key committees.
</P>
<P>
They have ample constitutional power to obstruct the president's
agenda and advance their own. The Senate has the authority to
confirm nominees and ratify treaties, and both houses can vote down
or condition appropriations for everything from foreign aid and
intelligence to troop deployments.
</P>
<P>
Sharper foreign policy debate can be healthy. The administration
has not performed so brilliantly that it can afford to brush off
useful criticism. No great philosophical differences divide Clinton
from mainstream Republicans on many issues, and both parties need
to consider how to reshape U.S. policies to a changed world.
</P>
<P>
What are America's interests today? What are appropriate uses of
U.S. military force? What is the right relationship between trade
expansion and other objectives?
</P>
<P>
As a candidate, Clinton promised dramatic reversals on a few
high-profile issues like Bosnia, China and Haiti. That rhetoric was
soon abandoned. Aside from Haiti, Clinton has generally kept George
Bush's policies in place while focusing on domestic reform. A broad
consensus is likely to continue over trade, the Middle East and
some elements of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Congressional challenges are likely over Bosnia, NATO, Russia,
China, peacekeeping and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders liken foreign aid to welfare and demand that
most aid not related to security or political aims be cut. But the
aid budget has already been cut by nearly a third over the last
five years, and most foreign aid is related to security or
political aims.
</P>
<P>
Of the $14 billion foreign aid budget, $5 billion is earmarked
for Israel and Egypt and another $1.2 billion goes to assist
countries trying to move from socialism to capitalism. Most of the
remainder goes to humanitarian, environmental and population
programs that are the best insurance against new Somalias and
Rwandas.
</P>
<P>
Republicans will press for more aggressive efforts to lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian government, efforts the
administration should try to harness and in some cases support.
</P>
<P>
Washington should make clear to its European allies that if they
prevent the United Nations from lifting the embargo, the
administration may be unable to resist Congressional pressure for
the United States to lift it independently.
</P>
<P>
The administration should vigorously resist all calls for direct
U.S. involvement in the war.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans favor incorporating Eastern European countries
in NATO, which would needlessly isolate and provoke Moscow. Eastern
Europe needs economic support and early access to the European
Union far more urgently than it needs new military guarantees. The
administration itself moved too hastily last year toward moving the
NATO security umbrella eastward.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream Republicans favor continued support for reform and
arms reduction in Russia, but want to make aid conditional on how
Moscow treats the former Soviet republics. Such conditioning must
be done carefully. America's security does not lie in isolating and
humiliating Russia, but in encouraging its constructive
participation in European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Republicans will also insist that Washington stand up more
forcefully to Chinese bullying on human rights, trade, Taiwan and
Tibet. A tougher line could help over time, but short-term progress
is unlikely with China already in the throes of a succession
struggle.
</P>
<P>
International peacekeeping has been a favorite Republican
target, even though the administration is now cautious to a fault
about committing U.S. troops to such operations. Recent U.N.
operations have been troubled. But peacekeeping is a cost-efficient
deal for the United States.
</P>
<P>
If the United Nations were so financially hobbled that it could
no longer mount operations in support of policies Washington
favors, American forces might have to act alone, at far greater
human and financial cost to the United States.
</P>
<P>
This administration still has a chance to leave a credible
foreign policy legacy, but for the next two years it will have to
do so in conjunction with mainstream Republicans like Sen. Richard
Lugar and Rep. Benjamin Gilman.
</P>
<P>
There will be unbridgeable differences. There should be
substantive debate. But with good will and good luck, the result
could be the kind of bipartisan foreign policy politicians often
rhapsodize about but rarely produce.

EDITORIAL: GEORGE PATAKI'S VISION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-EDIT-NY-PATAKI-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 2:
</P>
<P>
Early in Sunday's inaugural address, New York's new governor,
George Pataki, paid gracious tribute to Mario Cuomo. He then took
the next 35 minutes to make it unmistakably clear that the
government to expect under his leadership will be radically
different in attitude and agenda from anything New Yorkers have
known during Cuomo's 12 years in Albany.
</P>
<P>
``The people seek change,'' he said. ``Let us give them sweeping
and fundamental change that is certain and immediate.''
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of Pataki's philosophy of change, a theme to
which he returned again and again, is to restore a sense of
individual responsibility, and release individual energies, by
lightening the ``oppressive'' hand of government. There is, he
asserted, a sense of crisis among many people, but it is ``a crisis
not of the people's making but of the government's.'' And ``what
those in government have done, those in government can undo.''
</P>
<P>
This speech was a declaration of war on liberal, regulatory,
interventionist government, and it described his thinking more
fully than any campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
His agenda was predictably conservative: lower taxes, a leaner,
more responsive bureaucracy, lower government spending, privatized
government services, term limits. He pledged to work for safer
schools and safer streets: his call for the death penalty -- which
this page opposes -- drew the loudest applause.
</P>
<P>
Though not in his predecessor's class as an orator, Pataki was
full of earnest, even youthful enthusiasm. Summoning up New York's
past to inspire its future, he invoked the ``revolutionary spirit''
of Saratoga and the ``faith and optimism'' of Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
He also took his listeners on a kind an alliterative tour of New
York's cultural, scenic and commercial glories, from ``Rochester to
the Rockaways.'' He had kind words for New York City, where
suspicions about his agenda are the strongest.
</P>
<P>
Pataki's pledges to re-invent Albany and end the ``cycle of
dependency'' on government will resonate strongly with many New
Yorkers. One big question, however, is whether he can achieve his
aims without cruel damage to those who depend for basic subsistence
on many of the programs that Pataki has targeted for reform.
</P>
<P>
The poor did not figure heavily in this speech. Whereas Cuomo
had used his inaugurals to speak of government's responsibility to
the weak and the marginalized, Pataki referred just once to
society's ``solemn obligation'' to help ``those less fortunate.''
Yet even this reference came in the context of another attack on
the welfare system, which he said no longer operated as a safety
net but as a ``spider web'' of dependency.
</P>
<P>
The governor must now turn to the daunting task of translating
his promises into legislation and then into reality. But inaugurals
are not about the pesky details. They are about philosophy. Pataki
has left little doubt about where he is coming from and where he
wants to go.

DEMOCRATS TALK OF POWER ON THE LAST DAYS WITH IT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON  (BC-WASHINGTON-MOOD-540(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the dispirited troops of a defeated army,
Democrats and Congressional staff members prepared to relinquish
cherished posts and cluttered, file-filled cabinets on the eve of
the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives. Lunch
gatherings were grim, partings tearful and wishes for the new year
filled with gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
At the Ford Annex building, Judi Greenwald introduced several
colleagues as they were packing: ``We're with the subcommittee on
Energy and Power. At least we are until the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
The absolute, and at times absolutely capricious, exercise of
power on Capitol Hill was a recurrent theme throughout that long
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
Each of those staff members had known for nearly a year that
they would be unemployed come 1995, since Rep. Philip Sharp,
D-Ind., for whom they all worked, chose not to run for re-election.
But not one had expected to be part of a broader exodus.
</P>
<P>
``We knew a long time ago,'' Ms. Greenwald said. ``We just
didn't have any idea that we were going to be in a whole throng of
people.''
</P>
<P>
For Leon Lowery, who played Scrooge to everyone else's
Pollyanna, the departure had great import.
</P>
<P>
``Not only have you lost your personal job,'' he said somberly,
``but people are telling you that the whole ideology you represent
has been rejected by America. Personally, professionally,
emotionally -- any level you take -- it's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
Shelley Fidler just grimaced. ``Leon has been reading the
Bible,'' she said. ``Lamentations.''
</P>
<P>
Lowery raised an eyebrow that would have been jaundiced if
eyebrows could master such intricate attitude. ``A lot of people
don't believe in government,'' he said with a touch of devilish
revenge. ``But now they are going to have to run it.''
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was so morose. While assorted Democrats fretted,
feted and gnashed, Newt Gingrich and his newly minted Republican
majority were champing at the bit as they prepared to take over the
House.
</P>
<P>
Parties around the city were full of exuberant revelers still
toasting the November victory, while the recently anointed seemed
as anxious as new suitors as they prepared to move into new offices
across the Hill.
</P>
<P>
Washington's permanent population was already figuring to profit
from the shift. Among the first businesses to capitalize on the
change has been that most ephemeral and yet most constant of
Washington power bases: the trendy restaurants in which dining and
doing business combine.
</P>
<P>
``Republicans eat, too,'' said Steven Damato, the owner of
Nora's, a homey-trendy restaurant that is a favorite of President
Clinton's family.
</P>
<P>
Damato said the restaurant would be host to a Republican event
on Tuesday, one night before the 104th Congress convenes. And the
future looks good, too. ``Change is wonderful for business,'' he
said, capturing a Washington credo. ``The restaurants will be
packed full of special interests.''

Real estate agents were crowing as well, using the most potent
of Washington put-offs to archly inform reporters that they were
simply too busy to talk. Several moaned that they could not stay on
the phone for more than several minutes since their appointments
with incoming power brokers were stacked like salmon jumping the
rapids in spawning season.
</P>
<P>
``There has been an awful lot of scurrying around,'' said a very
rushed Mike Frias, an agent at John Forman Real Estate. By most
accounts, the new Washingtonians and the freshman invaders were
settling as near as possible to ground zero, in the Victorian row
houses and quaint apartments that bank the tree-lined but sometimes
crime-infested streets near Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
It makes for a blissfully short commute and great public
relations bites. ``These folks come in extremely early, work late.
If they have a break, they want to go home,'' Frias said. Few have
been buying properties, though.
</P>
<P>
``New members are not interested in giving their constituency
the impression that they are becoming entrenched,'' he explained.
Or else, just maybe, they have a clear and present sense of the
fickleness of a disgruntled electorate.
</P>
<P>
Over at revolution central, in federal buildings where
unsuspecting professionals have been chopped out of politics in
part of a general restructuring initiated by Gingrich, confusion
and resentment mixed with a poignant sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
``I guess I am looking for a job,'' said Dr. Raymond Smock, the
recently out-of-work House historian, who had to inform his staff
of five that they were also abruptly unemployed since the office
was decreed closed by the new House speaker. ``But, hey, I'm not
complaining. Five thousand Amtrak employees are out of work. Nobody
has any sympathy for anybody on the hill who lost his job.''
</P>
<P>
In federal buildings on the hill this week, offices were
exchanged and furniture dragged about in the traditional horse
trading that comes with the flip-flop of minority and majority
slots.
</P>
<P>
Republicans moved into majority cubbyholes. The erstwhile
majority slipped down to minority digs. But some offices just
closed for good -- all part of a extensive restructuring.
</P>
<P>
It is hard, though, to quantify the scope of change just now.
The House historian's office can not say because the facts and
figures of the 104th Congress are not history yet. By the time the
statistics emerge, the office will be long since obsolete itself.
</P>
<P>
Last week, even the House clerk's loyal staff could not answer
basic questions. Inquiries about staff changes, personnel cutbacks
and committee clear-outs were referred to Gingrich's office with
the rather terse advice: ``Ask him. He's the guy with the power.
He's only one who knows what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
The city's true denizens, of course, are used to all of this.
Washington's equivalent of a stiff upper lip is a rather chronic
sense of denial. ``We're used to this,'' said countless members of
the newly unemployed. ``It's politics.''
</P>
<P>
Subsets of the city were already gearing up for an adrenaline
rush, though.
</P>
<P>
John Brademas, the chairman of the President's Committee on Arts
and Humanities, girded for guerrilla warfare. A longtime
congressman and a former president of New York University, he knows
how to play politics with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
After rather sadly conceding that funding for the arts,
education and humanities are all prominent targets for the cutting
board, he mentioned almost casually that most of the prominent
board members of major opera companies, museums, theater groups
were powerful Republicans with ample funds and huge political
leverage.
</P>
<P>
``We're not quite sure what's going to happen yet,'' Brademas
said. ``But savage reductions in these programs would mark a giant
step backwards. And at least in my experience -- which stretches
back to Eisenhower -- every government has come up with funds.''
</P>
<P>
Fine and well for opera singers if that record holds. But the
House historian, Smock, really did seem to be watching history pass
by last week.
</P>
<P>
Tapping his foot against a nondescript wood crate, he rather
reverently mentioned that its contents were none other than the
private letters and records of former House Speaker Joe Cannon.
</P>
<P>
``It doesn't look like something out of `The Raiders of the Lost
Ark,' '' he said, creaking open the crate's top. ``But, hey, it's
the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
And in this city of smoked salmon and oversized mirrors, that is
rare indeed.

EUROPE WON'T PUSH YELTSIN ON POLICY FOR FEAR OF WEAKENING HIM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BONN, Germany  (BC-RUSSIA-EUROPE-ASSESS-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, the Russian foreign minister
horrified a gathering of 53 European countries in Stockholm by
announcing what he called ``a correction in the course of Russian
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev warned that Russia saw a threat
in overtures by NATO to formerly communist countries in Eastern
Europe, and in Western hostility to the Serbs in the war in Bosnia.
Moscow, he said, had a right to intervene militarily in what he
called the ``post-imperial space'' around it, and would not
hesitate to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
Then Kozyrev told his startled listeners that he didn't really
mean it -- that he was just trying to shock all of them into
realizing that President Boris Yeltsin's democratic and pro-Western
policies could be elbowed aside by Russian hardliners if the West
pushed him too hard in Eastern Europe and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, Western European leaders have been noticeably
reluctant to criticize Yeltsin's actions in Russia's backyard and
in Bosnia, for fear of weakening him.
</P>
<P>
They are more reluctant than ever now that some of Kozyrev's
prophecies appear to have come true with the Russian assault on the
rebellious province of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In an interview taped Friday and shown on Sunday on the NBC News
program ``Meet the Press,'' Kozyrev said that there was ``no other
way but to use force'' in Chechnya ``to reinstall law and order and
to rescue the population'' from criminals.
</P>
<P>
``It is just intolerable to have a military gang anywhere, be it
in the center of Moscow, be it in Los Angeles or whatever, or
Chechnya, and we have to put it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is on a first-name basis
with Yeltsin, had not called the Russian leader to express concern
at mounting civilian deaths in Chechnya, the chancellor's spokesman
said Friday. He said he had no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Kohl backed the message Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel passed to Kozyrev on Thursday on behalf of all his
European Union colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel did not warn Moscow to stop its attacks, as the Clinton
administration did the same day in a statement by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he expressed ``great concern'' over the situation in
Chechnya and the increasing number of civilian victims of the
military operations in the capital, Grozny. On Friday, in Moscow,
the Greek, German, and French ambassadors, on behalf of the
European Union, reiterated Kinkel's views in a formal diplomatic
demarche.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev agreed, the German Foreign Ministry said, that a
political solution had to be found as quickly as possible, one that
respected the agreements on human rights and the peaceful
settlement of disputes that Russia had signed within the framework
of the 53-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
That is apparently as far as most European leaders are willing
to push the Russians at the moment, to the dismay of advocates of
stronger international protest.
</P>
<P>
``With its inaction, the German government creates the
impression that Russia has a privileged status on violations of
human rights and the use of force in internal disputes,'' said one
of Kohl's critics, Norbert Gansel of the Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to several diplomats, the European and
American caution reflects growing concern that Yeltsin has already
lost ground to resurgent nationalists in Moscow, and fear that
stronger Western protest could make him weaker.
</P>
<P>
But the change in Russia's course has unsettled European
governments already shaken by disagreements with the United States
about what to do about the war in Bosnia, and how fast to invite
formerly Communist Eastern European countries into the Western
fold.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, American foreign policy seemed to Europeans to be
bending over backwards to allay Russian opposition to the possible
expansion of the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
Many senior European officials thought the U.S. position
reflected the influence of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, an expert on the former Soviet Union whom they suspected
of wanting smooth relations with Moscow even at the cost of Western
interests in the democracies of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
But over the last few months, American policy has changed.
</P>
<P>
Washington was riding roughshod over its allies, negotiating
terms of possible membership with the Eastern Europeans and
presenting NATO with accomplished facts instead of consulting with
them, the German representative to NATO, Hermann von Richthofen,
complained in a telegram to the Foreign Ministry in Bonn in
November.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher appeared to have patched
over the disagreement on Dec. 1, when he got NATO foreign ministers
to agree to let the alliance tell Eastern Europeans within the next
12 months what they had to do to qualify for eventual membership if
they wanted it.
</P>
<P>
But Kozyrev threw salt on the wounds the very same day, telling
the assembled allies that Russia would not sign on to a detailed
military cooperation plan with NATO until it found out what the
allies' new approach to Eastern Europe meant.
</P>
<P>
Whether this was a clever maneuver intended to exploit allied
differences or a reflection of Yeltsin's shaky grip in Moscow, it
reawakened European fears about losing Russian help in dealing with
the Serbs in the Balkans. The Russians are the only outside power
that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia listens to, in the
European view, and Milosevic is the best hope of pressing the
Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
With NATO temporarily paralyzed by British and French concern
about retaliation against their soldiers in Bosnia in the event of
allied air strikes, the Europeans prevailed in December with the
view that Russian diplomatic help in Bosnia was needed more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
Critics of inaction in Bosnia denounced that as weakness. The
underlying weakness may be that both European and American leaders
see no alternative to Yeltsin in Moscow. Whatever the Russian
military does in his name in the northern Caucasus, the prospect of
effective international opposition to more war there seems remote.

HOCKEY BARGAINING IS ON AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-HKN-LABOR-550ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Burke, a senior vice president of the National Hockey
League, was part of the small group that resumed bargaining Sunday
in an effort to end the lockout that has postponed the start of the
season for more than three months.
</P>
<P>
There were no details available from the subcommittee meeting,
which was held at an undisclosed site under a news media blackout.
It was expected that Burke and fellow NHL executive Jeff Pash would
represent the league. Two attorneys, Bob Riley and John
McCambridge, were to represent the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
These were the first such meetings since Dec. 17. Should the
small groups agree to a framework for a new collective bargaining
agreement, it is likely that they would be joined by Gary Bettman,
commissioner of the league, and Bob Goodenow, executive director of
the union. Those two haven't bargained since Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
Bettman said last week that play must begin by Jan. 16 if each
team is to play 50 regular-season games, followed by a full playoff
tournament before July 1. Without an agreement, the entire season
could be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if Burke has time between bargaining sessions, he
might get to read a paper on labor disputes in sports recently
written by Paul Weiler, the Henry J. Friendly professor of law at
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
Weiler, a specialist in labor and sports law, calls the paper
``A Prescription for the Sports Disease.'' It will be part of a
book called ``Sports on Trial,'' which he expects to publish next
year.
</P>
<P>
Weiler recently sent Burke a copy of his theories. That made
sense, since the two men go back a long way. ``Brian was my first
student in the sports law program that I developed 15 years ago
here at Harvard,'' Weiler said Sunday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Weiler feels part of hockey's difficulty is that team owners
don't separate two different problems. One is of salary escalation,
which they can't solve without player help; the other is disparity
of revenue between big and small markets, which they can solve on
their own. If they would agree to share revenue in a way that
involves business principals and not internal charity, they
wouldn't need to demand what Weiler calls ``a draconian tax'' on
player payrolls.
</P>
<P>
``The big-market owners are saying, `We don't want to give any
charity to the small-market owners from ourselves, but we don't
mind getting a little bit of charity from our players,''' Weiler
said. ``What they really want is for the players to give away their
money to the small-market owners through a very, very rigid,
punitive salary tax.''
</P>
<P>
The demand for a tax of up to 25 percent on total payrolls is
what led to the last breakdown in talks. The players call it a
salary cap in disguise. While acknowledging that owners might be
suffering losses overall as a group and that the union should have
studied the league's financial condition before the current crisis,
Weiler said the union also has acknowledged the problem through
deed, if not word, during bargaining.
</P>
<P>
``Goodenow and the players have made significant concessions to
put a drag on salaries,'' Weiler said. ``At a certain point, you
have to know when to declare victory. The owners in hockey should
declare victory and should say `We've gotten enough, and we can do
the revenue-sharing thing ourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Weiler said that in sports bargaining, unlike in other
industries, there is a ``huge crisis every go-round'' and a mood
that ``unless you solve the whole crisis all at once, you haven't
done a thing.''
</P>
<P>
As for revenue-sharing, Weiler said big-revenue teams oppose it
because they think of it as charity. He noted that many
small-market team owners are wealthy as individuals, and that they
should pay fair value for the right to share revenue.
</P>
<P>
``It should be perceived as a sale of a portion of the revenues,
just the same as if the Canadiens or the Bruins sold off part of
the value of the team,'' Weiler said. ``If the Canadiens give part
of their revenues, from their big market, to Quebec, and if the
Bruins give part of their revenue to Hartford, the owners of the
Nordiques and Whalers should pay for it.
</P>
<P>
``You sell off the right to a flow of revenue in the future, and
you get the full capitalized value of that. The owners didn't see
this. That's one of the things that bugs me.''

EX-GIANTS REUNION: TWO COACHES, TWO LINEBACKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEVELAND  (BC-FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the New England Patriots played the Browns here
late in the 1993 season, Pepper Johnson approached Bill Parcells
during the warmups.
</P>
<P>
``Why,'' the Browns linebacker asked, ``did you leave me?''
</P>
<P>
Once together on the Giants' two Super Bowl championship teams,
they separated in 1991 when Parcells resigned as coach. And after
Parcells joined the Patriots as their coach in 1993, Johnson was
signed by Bill Belichick -- once his Giants' defensive coordinator --
after he had surprisingly been sliced by Dan Reeves, the Giants'
coach.
</P>
<P>
But Sunday Parcells, Belichick, the linebacker known as Pepper
and another Giant linebacker of their Super Bowl era, Carl Banks,
were together again as the Browns eliminated the growing Patriots,
20-13, in an American Conference wild-card confrontation in the
Super Bowl XXIX playoffs. Together and yet so separate.
</P>
<P>
``He's just another coach like I am when the game's on,''
Parcells was saying now, referring to Belichick. ``Tomorrow it'll
be different.''
</P>
<P>
When Sunday's game ended in the raw gray chill of Cleveland
Stadium, it was different. Parcells and Belichick hugged at
midfield as Johnson and Banks mingled with them. Banks joined the
Browns this year after having spent the 1993 season with the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
``When you play defense in the playoffs,'' Parcells said,
``you're going to be representative in the playoffs. Our problem
was turning the ball over late.''
</P>
<P>
One of those turnovers occurred when Johnson, who had sacked
Drew Bledsoe early in the fourth quarter, intercepted the Patriots
quarterback at the Browns' 31-yard line.
</P>
<P>
``That ball was tipped by Bill Johnson,'' Johnson said,
referring to one of the Browns' defensive tackles. ``It just fell
into my arms.''
</P>
<P>
Bob Kratch, once a Giant guard and signed by Parcells, thought
that the Browns' use of their linebackers resembled what the
Giants' 1990 championship defense did.
</P>
<P>
``We expected them to blitz as much as they did during the
regular season,'' Kratch said, referring to the Browns' 13-6
victory here on Nov. 6. ``We figured we'd see everything. They
didn't blitz nearly as much, but Pepper got his sack on a blitz.''
</P>
<P>
To Kratch, the Belichick influence on the Browns has created the
look of an National Conference East team.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think of the Cleveland Browns as an AFC team,'' Kratch
said. ``It seems like old-time football.''
</P>
<P>
But the Browns' defense, with its 4-3 alignment, is different
than that of the two-time champion Giants.
</P>
<P>
``And the blitzing philosophy is different,'' Johnson said.
``When we blitzed with the Giants, it was a change of pace. And
when Lawrence Taylor rushed, we didn't even call that a blitz.
Here, we blitz to get momentum on our side. With the Giants, we
blitzed on our own. Here, the blitzes are called.''
</P>
<P>
Even so, Banks described the Browns' basic defensive philosophy
as basically similar to that of the Giants under Parcells and
Belichick.
</P>
<P>
``The thing it shares is good tough football,'' Banks said. ``We
don't take a lot of risks, which means our margin of error should
be low. And we expect our players to be good tacklers.''
</P>
<P>
That defense will take the Browns to Pittsburgh for Saturday's
divisional playoff, but the Steelers have an even better defense.
</P>
<P>
During the season the Steelers swept the Browns, 17-10 in
Cleveland in the second game and 17-7 in Three Rivers Stadium two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
``Defense is still the key,'' Parcells has often said. ``The
teams that are going to win the big games are the good defensive
teams.''
</P>
<P>
In other years, Parcells sprung surprise plays in post-season
games: Gary Reason's ramble with a direct snap on a fake punt in
the 1990 NFC championship game in San Francisco, Jeff Rutledge's
quarterback sneak off a fake punt in Super Bowl XXI against the
Denver Broncos. Yesterday he had the punter Pat O'Neill pass for a
first down on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
``It's just a play we had ready,'' Parcells said. ``We always
have plays like that.''
</P>
<P>
But for all the dazzling development of Bledsoe as a young
quarterback and for all the justly earned coach-of-the-year honors
for Parcells, the Patriots still need a few more cement blocks in
their defense if they are to be a true Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
Parcells had two rookie linebackers, Willie McGinest and Marty
Moore, out there on defense. No team ever gets too far into the
Super Bowl playoffs with two rookie linebackers.
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots have the coach and they have the quarterback.
And when McGinest and Moore develop, just as Pepper Johnson and
Carl Banks once developed under Bill Parcells long before they
tormented him as opponents Sunday, the Patriots will be a team to
fear.

WORLD WATCHES TO SEE HOW ZEDILLO DEALS WITH FALLEN PESO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY  (BC-MEXICO-ECON-475(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon goes
on national television Monday night to outline his plan for
rebuilding the crippled Mexican economy, he will also be doing his
best to convince investors that the Mexican market they once
thought the world of was not a mirage.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo worked through the New Year's weekend to put the
finishing touches on an economic-stabilization plan that will limit
wages, prices and government spending while lining up the financial
backing of the United States and Canada, major European nations,
American commercial banks and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
In the United States as well as Mexico, investment bankers,
money managers and financial analysts will be watching to see how
Zedillo -- in office just a month -- applies the economics he learned
at Stanford and refined at the Mexican central bank to this
politically explosive situation. His challenge will be to lay out
an economic recovery, while setting a national agenda that can keep
the lid on simmering social problems bound to be aggravated by the
disastrous devaluation of the peso last month.
</P>
<P>
Along with the details of a govenment agreement with labor and
business that will be disclosed on Monday night, President
Zedillo's stabilization plan will set much of Mexico's economic
course for 1995. The most important points are expected to be
these:
</P>
<P>
-- How does Zedillo intend to control inflation without causing a
recession and possibly increasing social unrest?
</P>
<P>
-- How will price controls be enforced?
</P>
<P>
-- What policy will Mexico use to set exchange rates?
</P>
<P>
-- Which government-owned companies will be sold to investors to
raise badly needed dollars?
</P>
<P>
-- What is the size and structure of the international rescue
package, and will it be sufficient to restore investors'
confidence?
</P>
<P>
``The main risk is that when you already are under a lot of
pressure, you have to be real convincing,'' said Neal M. Soss, an
economic consultant in New York. ``The world can be in an
unforgiving frame of mind. If his plan doesn't appear to cover all
the bases, and doesn't offer well-thought-out answers to all
questions, he runs the risk of having another flight of capital.''
</P>
<P>
The peso's devaluation could turn out to be enormously damaging
for Mexico. A study by Bear, Stearns  Co. estimates that if the
peso trades at a rate of about 4.90 to the dollar -- it closed at
5.0750 to the dollar on Friday -- Mexico's gross domestic product
could fall to $250 billion in 1995 from $333 billion in 1993.
Per-capita income might decline to $2,700 from $3,600 in 1993. The
national debt would increase to 40 percent of gross domestic
product, up from 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
To make his stabilization plan work, Zedillo will rely on the
same sort of pact with labor and business that Mexican
administrations have used for the last seven years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agreement, backed by the persuasive powers of a party that
has been in control for 65 years, helped get government, labor and
business to agree to hold down prices, wages and public spending.
All these groups stopped making wage and price demands based on
existing inflation rates and agreed instead to work toward steadily
improving targets, which helped bring down inflation to 8 percent
in 1993, from 159 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo is expected to reject the standing commitment to a
semi-fixed exchange rate policy and adopt a more flexible system.
</P>
<P>
In previous pacts, the government agreed to hold the line on
prices for goods it produces, like electricity and gasoline. It
also pledged to keep the value of the peso within a tight trading
band, no matter what changes took place in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the peso got stronger -- which Mexicans liked
because it meant that books, breakfast cereal or almost anything
produced in the United States got cheaper.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1992, imports grew by 238 percent. Exports
increased by only 73 percent in the same years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, Mexico was importing so much more than it
was exporting that it had accumulated a deficit of $28 billion. The
government financed the debt with foreign money, a tactic that
became impossible after investors started turning away from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
That led to a week-long speculative run on the peso, which ended
just before Christmas. The government decided that it did not have
enough money in reserve to defend the peso, and was forced to
allowed it to float freely.
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, Mexico's currency fell in value by almost 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have accused the Mexican government of hubris,
saying that finance officials had become overly confident they
could ward off any assault on the peso. They entered the crisis
with $17 billion in reserves and standby lines of credit totaling
about $7 billion from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
This was not enough. More than $10 billion was pulled out of the
country, first by Mexican investors, then by foreigners that week
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is now looking for even greater backing from its trading
partners. In the package that is already lined up, the Bank for
International Settlements in Switzerland, which represents the
central banks of Europe, will lend Mexico $6 billion to $10
billion. In addition, several American commercial banks have been
asked to syndicate a loan of $3 billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
There may also be some help from the International Monetary
Fund, particularly in supervising the way Mexico handles the loans
and its emergency stabilization plan. The appointment on Thursday
of Guillermo Ortiz as finance minister -- in place of Jaime Serra
Puche, who resigned -- could prove useful, as he worked as an
executive director of the IMF from 1984 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say international backing will create confidence
and help Mexico hold on to the foreign investments that have not
yet been pulled out. One of Mexico's biggest concerns is the $30
billion in government notes known as tesobonos that come due in
1995. The notes are paid in pesos but are pegged to dollars, and
the devaluation has substantially increased Mexico's obligations.
</P>
<P>
To encourage investors to roll over those notes instead of
cashing them in, the central bank is expected to offer to replace
mature tesobonos with something called sovereign debt bonds that
will have longer terms and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Another important part of Zedillo's plan is to raise the
government's dollar revenue by speeding up the privatization of
ports, petrochemical plants and electricity-generating stations.
The government will also try to exploit the short-term price
advantages of the devaluation to stem the flow of imports while
increasing exports. The plan calls for cutting the current-account
deficit of more than $28 billion by more than half by year's end.
</P>
<P>
Some economists think this goal is overly optimistic. But after
the 1982 devaluation, the current-account deficit fell to $6
billion from $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
So far, the loudest complaints about the peso devaluation have
come from foreign investors. The Mexican people, in many cases
preoccupied with the holidays and their vacations, have not yet
said much. Mexicans who have lived through other devaluations know
they will again be asked to sacrifice. After the devaluation of
1982, for example, real wages fell 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's outlook for the new year has already changed. When
Zedillo took office on Dec. 1, the government's official estimates
for 1995 were a growth rate of 4 percent, inflation of 4 percent
and salary increases of about 10 percent, substantially above the
rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Now, government economists are predicting 1 to 2 percent growth,
15 percent inflation and wage increases that do not keep up with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Inflation ravaged Mexico in the early 1980s and is again a
central concern. ``The most difficult part of the recovery will be
to really keep inflation in check,'' said Nora Lustig, an economist
with the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The prices of products made of domestic material and sold in
Mexico should not be affected by the devaluation. But after a
devaluation, a kind of panic sets in and pushes everyone to raise
prices, regardless of whether the product is imported.
</P>
<P>
Just a few days after the government said that prices across the
board had been frozen for 60 days, the federal consumer protection
agency shut down 27 stores in greater Mexico City for jacking up
the prices of -- among other things -- tortillas and milk.
</P>
<P>
``The government will probably be able to get agreement from the
business leaders not to raise prices, but what if there is no
discipline in the ranks?'' Ms. Lustig said. ``What is supposed to
be a single jump in prices to reflect the devaluation could become
a spiral.''

RESCUED FRENCH SOLO SAILOR TAKEN TO AUSTRALIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-FRANCE-SAILOR-RESCUE-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Isabelle Autissier, the French solo sailor who was airlifted
from her stricken yacht Saturday in the Indian Ocean, said on
Sunday that a huge wave had crippled her boat by rolling it over
360 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Autissier is expected to arrive on Monday in Adelaide,
Australia, aboard an Australian Navy frigate, the HMAS Darwin.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old competitor in the BOC round-the-world race told
competition officials by radio that she was fortunate to have been
below deck when the wave hit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
``If I had been on the deck, I would have been washed away,''
she said, referring to her 60-foot yacht, Ecureuil Poitou-Charentes
2.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 850 miles southwest of Hobart,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
``The wind was blowing over 50 knots,'' she said, ``and I was
making 8 knots with all my sails down. I was inside the boat, very
fortunately for me, inside a narrow passage. I could hear the noise
of a very big wave coming.''
</P>
<P>
The rollover filled the boat with water, and forced Autissier to
slam shut a rear bulkhead door to keep the yacht from sinking. She
moved her food and clothing to a forward part of the hull, where
she lived until being rescued.
</P>
<P>
The force of being turned upside down caused part of the deck to
cave in. Once the boat righted itself again, Autissier covered the
15-foot hole with a sail to try to keep water out. She had no
steering, and knew that her only hope for survival was to set off
two emergency radio beacons. The satellite distress calls were
relayed to race officials in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
A Sea Hawk-class helicopter plucked Autissier from her damaged
yacht three days later. The helicopter was brought within 100-miles
of Autissier by the HMAS Darwin. Salvagers left Hobart on Sunday to
try and retrieve Autissier's sailboat.

CARDOSO INAUGURATED AS PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRASILIA, Brazil  (BC-BRAZIL-POLITICS-600ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a 63-year-old
sociologist, was inaugurated as Brazil's president on Sunday,
promising to give all his energy to banishing inflation from Latin
America's largest nation.
</P>
<P>
``The majority of Brazilians made a clear choice'' for low
inflation and high growth, Cardoso said, referring to his landslide
electoral victory in October.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso, the architect of Brazil's radically successful
anti-inflation plan, also vowed in his inaugural address before
Congress to further open Brazil to foreign investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
With ``the opening of the Brazilian economy, we are leaving
behind xenophobic attitudes,'' said Cardoso, whose government
experience includes recent stints as foreign minister and finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
``Today, there is no serious specialist who does not forecast
for Brazil anything but a long period of growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While 21-gun salutes and fighter jet flyovers noisily marked
Cardoso's new role as commander in chief on Sunday, some recalled
that he was once exiled and blacklisted for his opposition to
Brazil's military rule, a period that lasted from 1964 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
``It's an irony I savor,'' a longtime friend of Cardoso, Peter
D. Bell, recalled from New York. When Bell worked for the Ford
Foundation in Rio de Janeiro in 1969, U.S. Embassy officials
unsuccessfully pressured him to withhold funding for a study group
Cardoso was forming. The American officials argued Cardoso was a
Communist and that he had no future in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
``Fernando Henrique's real crime was that he was a card-carrying
democrat,'' said Bell, who is a chairman of the Inter-American
Dialogue, a Washington-based policy group. ``In the context of the
military dictatorship, democrats were seen as upsetting the apple
cart.''
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, Cardoso is a social democrat who enjoys
heavy business support. On Sunday, he appealed in his nationally
televised speech: ``Let us retire the old ideological dilemmas and
the old forms of confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
On a day of gray skies and intermittent rain, this young capital
exuded optimism, recalling the days in the 1960s when it was called
``the capital of hope.''
</P>
<P>
``Exceptional flight conditions,'' Brazil's leading business
magazine, Exame, said of Cardoso's prospects. ``No president has
ever started his mandate in such an auspicious situation.''
</P>
<P>
In a survey released on Sunday by the Datafolha polling
organization, 70 percent of respondents predicted that the Cardoso
government would be ``good'' or ``great.''
</P>
<P>
Unfazed by the dramatic devaluation of the Mexican peso over the
last 10 days, many Brazilians believe that their country is
embarking on an economic boom that will rival the miracle years of
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
``Thanks to the success of the Real Plan and to the election of
its author as president, we are entering a new era, with the best
chances and the best expectations that the country has ever had,''
Roberto Civita, publisher of Veja, the nation's most influential
newsweekly, wrote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Real Plan, implemented on July 1, slashed Brazil's monthly
inflation rate from 45 percent in June to 2 percent in December.
Low inflation triggered a spending boom that boosted factory
production, cutting unemployment. Brazil recorded 5 percent growth
in 1994, a level that is expected to be equaled in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround has been so decisive that Itamar Franco left
Brazil's presidency on Sunday with an 88 percent approval rating,
the highest on record for a departing Brazilian president.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the low inflation and high growth, investors have
flooded into Sao Paulo's stock market, and foreign investment is
expected to grow. Cardoso has also promised to speed Brazil's
program of privatizing state companies.
</P>
<P>
To meet his 1995 goals of 6 percent growth and 26 percent annual
inflation, Cardoso will have to marshal congressional support to
change Brazil's Constitution to allow more foreign investment, to
transfer health and education duties to states, to raise more taxes
and to close a yawning pension fund deficit.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Congress reconvenes on March 1, and, at least for the
first few months, Cardoso is expected to enjoy majority support.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Brazil's 594 congressional representatives
support Brazil's new president, according to Marcos Antonio Maciel,
the nation's new vice president.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso was elected on Oct. 3 with twice as many votes as his
closest competitor, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. On Sunday, in
inaugurations throughout Brazil, Cardoso allies became governors in
9 out of 10 of the most populous states, including Rio, Sao Paulo
and Minas Gerais.
</P>
<P>
In composing his Cabinet, Cardoso expanded his three-party
electoral coalition to include the Brazilian Democratic Movement
Party, the largest of 19 political parties represented in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet is largely composed by men who are more than 45
years old, who have American university study on their resumes, and
who are natives of Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
One exception is the special minister for sports: Edson Arantes
do Nascimento, the retired soccer star known throughout the world
as Pele. The first black in memory to be appointed to a
Cabinet-level post, he has vowed to bring soccer fields to the
millions of Brazilian children who live in urban shantytowns
without access to sports facilities.

CHANGE AT ONE SOUTHERN CHURCH IS SWEET, AT ANOTHER SOUR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHARLOTTE, N.C.  (BC-SEGREGATED-PRAYER-950(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can see it as a tale of two Southern
churches, both grappling with a question that not too long ago
would have been unthinkable: What happens to a white church when it
gets a black pastor?
</P>
<P>
The very different way the story has unfolded in the last six
months at Christ United Methodist Church outside Birmingham, Ala.,
and at Plaza United Methodist Church here goes to show that
integration can be sweet and smooth -- when it means blacks' being
accepted into white institutions. When the goal is a genuine
melding of blacks and whites on equal terms into institutions
shaped by both, it is another matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
``Sometimes you can take the temperature of society better in
church than you can outside it,'' said the Rev. Dr. Percy Reeves,
who was appointed pastor last summer at Plaza United, a white
church in a neighborhood that has gone from black to white. ``And I
think we're finding that everything in society -- what real
integration means, how to share power, how to have a partnership --
is playing out at our church. We have a shot at it, but it's not
going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
To a remarkable degree, 11 a.m. on Sunday, when whites generally
go to white churches and blacks to black ones, remains the most
segregated time in American society. And for the overwhelming
majority of churches in the South or elsewhere in the United
States, the idea of a black person leading a white church is as
unlikely as the thought of a white person leading the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some intriguing signs of change.
</P>
<P>
In October, major Pentecostal denominations united in a new
association that brings together some 10 million black and white
members of the nation's fastest-growing Christian movement.
</P>
<P>
And, largely because of the efforts of the United Methodist
Church to foster integration in congregations, it is no longer rare
to see what was once unheard of: blacks heading white Southern
churches.
</P>
<P>
Blacks lead white United Methodist churches here in Charlotte
and in a suburb of Birmingham, Brevard, N.C.; Augusta and Columbus,
Ga., and Greenville and Clemson, S.C. Black priests preside over
Roman Catholic parishes in Boone and Hickory, N.C., and in Atlanta.
Blacks head congregations of the Unity Church here and in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
Outside the South, there are black pastors presiding over
largely white congregations at churches like the Evangelical
Assembly of God in Chicago, the First Baptist Church of Vacaville,
Calif., and the Riverside Church in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
To see evidence of racial progress, it is necessary only to go
to the Christ United Methodist Church on the outskirts of
Birmingham, once one of the South's strongest bastions of
segregation. On the pulpit is the Rev. Charles H. Lee, a black
pastor who peers out at the green upholstered pews full of white
families wearing plastic name tags.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who grew up in Georgiana, Ala., remembers when blacks
tentatively began to move from the back of the bus to the front,
long after the Jim Crow laws had been overturned. To some extent he
believes his ministry at the church is part of the same process, an
effort to knit together people in a way that no legislation or
government action could ever do.
</P>
<P>
``Legislative actions brought people together and that bore some
lasting fruits,'' said Lee, who was placed at Christ United by the
denomination's administators. ``But in the church, as opposed to
civil society and the legal environment, people are free to do as
they wish, and so perhaps people travel a bit more slowly in their
freedom than they do when they are legally brought together.''
</P>
<P>
Parishioners at the affably informal church, where the music
minister takes hymn requests and the congregants applaud the music,
say Lee has been a big success.
</P>
<P>
``This is a very tolerant church, more so than a lot of churches
out there,'' said Cliff Capps, as he sat before services one day
last summer, waiting to meet his son after Sunday school. ``I'm
glad to be part of history, if that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
But tolerance comes easily when it's on one's own terms. Here in
Charlotte, where Reeves, a 35-year-old former tailback for the
University of South Carolina, was brought in to guide a white
church, the path has been much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Situated in a middle-class neighborhood that has gone from white
to black, Plaza United has been losing members for years, and the
120 or so worshipers who attend on an average Sunday do not nearly
fill the pews. Total membership is 389. When Reeves was hired last
summer, more than a few members felt it was a sign that the church,
too, would go from white to black.
</P>
<P>
About eight families left as soon as he was hired. Others hung
on but were wary. For many, the issue was about culture as much as
race.
</P>
<P>
``People want to see this as a simple matter of racism, but it's
really an ethos issue, one where the spiritual dimension of the
church mixes with the cultural,'' said the Rev. Dr. Donald Haynes,
superintendent of the Charlotte District of the United Methodist
Church, who was excoriated by some members for bringing in Reeves.
``Do you want the culture to remain an Anglo church in terms of
music and what we call the worship ethos, or do you want the black
experience to be reflected? And can you serve the community if you
do the first one and can you maintain the old members if you do the
second?''
</P>
<P>
Charles Lamm, who as Plaza United's board chairman had opposed
Reeves's appointment, became the keeper of the old virtues. If the
preacher went on past noon, which is standard practice at black
churches, Lamm would get up and open the church doors. If the
sermon's decibel level got too high for the ears of the white
parishoners, he would hold his hand up to his ear as a signal to
tone things down.
</P>
<P>
``Percy Reeves, in my opinion, is a very capable minister,''
Lamm said in an interview in September. ``He preaches a doggone
good sermon. But if you start to make radical changes very quickly,
then you're going to upset people. I think Percy Reeves is
intelligent enough to see the necessity to walk a tightrope and
handle it appropriately.''

<P>
But finding that balance was not easy. Some congregants said the
services tended to ramble on past noon, the music sometimes veered
toward the gospel of the black church, and soon each Sunday took on
the feel of a melodrama in which each inflection, hymn or
digression could be seen as a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in October, Reeves made it clear that his goal
was to change the church to better serve its largely black
neighborhood. He was hopeful but not confident that the
congregation would support that change.
</P>
<P>
``Can it work? I don't know,'' he said, sitting in his office,
its walls decorated with portraits of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ``I just know that there are
certain things that every church has to do, and that is it has to
relate to its community. It just so happens that ours is changing
and becoming progressively black.''
</P>
<P>
Week by week, the drama played out, with many members becoming
upset by local publicity about the church's direction. Eventually,
it became mixed with grief. In October, Lamm's wife, Becky, one of
the bulwarks of the congregation, died after an extended bout with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
In November, Lamm and Reeves met with the church's regional
bishop and had a long, emotional conversation about the church's
future, not entirely seeing eye to eye, but both coming to some
common ground and finding mutual respect. The pastor drove Lamm
home, and the two agreed to talk some more.
</P>
<P>
They never got the chance. Lamm died in his sleep that night. As
he had done for Lamm's wife a month earlier, Reeves presided over
his funeral.
</P>
<P>
If the experience of Methodist churches in cities like Atlanta
and Houston is a guide, the chances of Plaza United's remaining
largely white or truly integrated are not great.
</P>
<P>
And yet, despite talk by some members of forming a new
congregation, the Plaza United congregation has made it clear that
it wants the current one to work. At an emotional meeting on Dec.
13, members expressed their fears and frustrations, but they
overwhelmingly supported Reeves.
</P>
<P>
Attendance is about what it was when he arrived, and sometimes
higher. The number of black families in the congregation has
increased from 3 to 10, but some old members have begun coming back
and visitors have included blacks as well as whites.
</P>
<P>
``It's really turned into an affirmation of Percy and his work
here,'' said Ken Worthy, a white police officer who is the new
board chairman. ``People want him to stay and do God's work at
Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
For his part, Reeves remains skeptical, hopeful and exhilarated
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
``It's been frustrating at times, but this is the most exciting
thing I've ever been involved in,'' he said. ``This is uncharted
territory. You can't legislate it. You can't force it. It has to
come from people's hearts. For now, it's coming.''

DESPITE SETTLEMENT, BITTERNESS LINGERS AT RACETRACKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ARCADIA, Calif.  (BC-RAC-LABOR-600ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a gathering place near the stable
area at Santa Anita race track where jockeys, trainers and agents
congregate every morning to swap stories and line up mounts for
upcoming races.
</P>
<P>
All last week, the activity was frenzied, and tension was thick.
Because the nation's leading riders were threatening a walkout over
insurance coverage, there was a group of unfamiliar men auditioning
for roles as replacements.
</P>
<P>
On one side of the pathway, well-known jockeys such as Gary
Stevens and Randy Romero huddled. On the other side stood the
replacements who were ready to swing into action if Stevens, Romero
and their like declined to ride. Neither group made eye contact
with the other.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the morning after a settlement with the race tracks
prevented a walkout by the nation's leading jockeys, most of the
replacement riders had vanished. But the friction remained and
figured to linger for months to come.
</P>
<P>
Jockeys' Guild members who originally declined mounts for
Sunday's races -- on what would have been the first day of the
walkout -- felt betrayed by guild members who chose to ride. Jockeys
who are not members of the guild felt the guild had put the
interests of riders ahead of the health of the sport.
</P>
<P>
And yet racing, at least until the new contract expires in three
years, avoided the labor strife that has crippled baseball and
hockey. Brian McGrath, the commissioner of the Thoroughbred Racing
Associations, had accomplished something missing from the resumes
of Bud Selig and Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
Racing also offered a precursor of what may happen in baseball
this spring. Will replacement players, like replacement jockeys, be
recruited to keep the show going? Will some players break ranks
with the union and take the field, just as some Jockeys' Guild
members were prepared to ride despite the dispute? And what
lingering effects will there be on the field if and when the strike
is settled and the major leaguers come back?
</P>
<P>
Jockeys were asking themselves some of those questions this
weekend, examining their relationships with one another and with
the guild. Among those doing so were Stevens and Diane Nelson, both
successful jockeys who found themselves at polar opposites in this
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Stevens, based in Southern California, has been in the guild
since he started riding in 1979 and now is on the guild's board of
directors. He declined to be named on mounts Friday morning when
entries were taken for Sunday's races, and said he was prepared to
``to sit out until eternity and flip hamburgers at McDonald's, if
that's what it takes'' to get a palatable settlement.
</P>
<P>
And though a deal was reached in time to keep Stevens riding, he
felt hurt by the jockeys who would have replaced him.
</P>
<P>
``We were trying to help the smaller riders, and yet those are
the guys who were going to ride,'' Stevens said. ``I have nothing
but respect for the smaller guys who said they wouldn't ride, but I
have no respect for those who said they would.''
</P>
<P>
Nelson, based at Aqueduct in New York, was scheduled to ride no
matter the status of negotiations between the guild and TRA.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't feel like I was crossing because I'm not a member of
the Guild,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
``I have my own insurance,'' she added. ``For me to stop working
and not take care of my business, and to get the owners and
trainers mad at me, would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
Therein lies one of the many reasons why the jockeys could not
show the solidarity that thus far has united the baseball and
hockey players. For starters, the guild is not a union; all jockeys
who decided to sit out had to chose so individually.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Membership in the guild is not mandatory, though most of the
better-known jockeys are members. And jockeys have a number of
persons to whom they must answer. In effect, they are employed
every race by a different owner and trainer.
</P>
<P>
``The jockeys are going to need to get the owners and the
trainers behind them and then bargain with the tracks,'' said Ron
McAnally, a trainer based at Santa Anita. ``That's the only way
they'll get what they want. They have to discuss this with
everyone, not go and say they're going to stop riding. They don't
have enough riders in the guild to stop racing.''
</P>
<P>
The guild is in a precarious position. Many riders believe it is
the jockeys' best voice, one that has fought for improvements such
as safety rails and protective vests. But even a long-time
supporter like Stevens found his emotions roiling.
</P>
<P>
``The guild may not be the best organization in racing, but it's
all we've got,'' he said. ``But I'm going to take a step back and
take a long, hard look why I'm in the guild. Unless the riders
stand together, we'll revert to the conditions we had 30 years ago.
I know none of those jocks who were going to ride were thinking
about Gary Stevens. I'm going to have to worry about Gary Stevens
more than I did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
Regardless, this episode hasn't exactly persuaded Nelson to join
the guild.
</P>
<P>
``It should have never come to this in the first place,'' she
said.

BATTLE OVER DNA EVIDENCE EXPECTED IN O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES  (BC-SIMPSON-DNA-3Takes-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago, two prominent scientists who have
been vocal opponents in the battle over the use of DNA testing in
court jointly announced in a respected scientific journal that
``the DNA fingerprinting wars are over.''
</P>
<P>
But no peace yet has been declared in the courtroom of Superior
Court Judge Lance Ito, who beginning Thursday will preside over
what could be a long and hard-fought hearing over DNA tests in the
O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with conflicting appellate court decisions, teams of
clashing experts and massive motions detailing the eye-glazing
technicalities, Ito must decide whether the results of DNA tests on
blood taken from the crime scene and Simpson's home and car can be
presented to the jury.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Newsweek magazine quoted sources as saying
Simpson's attorneys will file a motion asking that the hearing be
jettisoned, or significantly curtailed, thus speeding up the start
of testimony in the often-delayed trial.
</P>
<P>
``We're assuming Ito will let the evidence in for the jury to
determine the weight (it should be given),'' a defense source told
Newsweek. ``Judges decide admissibility; juries decide
believability. We're willing to go right to phase two.''
</P>
<P>
At stake in what is known as a Kelly-Frye hearing are test
results that prosecutors claim implicate Simpson in the June 12
stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman --
crucial evidence in a case without eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Further complicating matters is the fact that prosecutors have
subjected blood samples to two different types of DNA tests, one of
which -- known as PCR testing -- has undergone far less judicial
review and thus is more vulnerable to defense challenges.
</P>
<P>
Citing a significant potential for contamination in PCR tests,
the defense served notice during Simpson's preliminary hearing in
July that it will argue that police investigators mishandled the
blood samples from the start.
</P>
<P>
``I'm expecting a real battle over PCR and the various kinds of
PCR evidence,'' predicted Myrna Raeder, a professor at Southwestern
University School of Law who specializes in evidentiary issues.
</P>
<P>
In court papers filed in July, prosecutors said most of the
blood samples would be subjected to some kind of PCR analysis.
However, in an effort to undermine key defense arguments, they have
ordered multiple tests performed at two different laboratories.
</P>
<P>
In light of recent scientific and legal developments, trial
observers are more confident that prosecutors will be able to
persuade Ito to allow them to use the DNA test known as RFLP --
considered the most definitive.
</P>
<P>
Although state appellate courts have split on the issue, the
most recent opinion upheld the use of RFLP tests, quoting the ``war
is over'' pronouncement of Eric Lander, the molecular biologist
frequently quoted by Simpson attorneys, and Bruce Budowle, chief
scientist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
There is ``no remaining problem that should prevent the full use
of DNA evidence in any court,'' Lander and Budowle wrote in the
British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
Harvard population geneticist David Hartl, whose 1991 article
criticizing the way DNA test results are presented to juries is
another mainstay of the Simpson team, said last week he agrees with
Lander and Budowle.
</P>
<P>
``There has been a lot of effort by both sides (of the debate)
to confuse the issues in this case,'' Hartl said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, the scientific issues are settled. Everything else is
not science, it's public policy.''
</P>
<P>
DNA typing -- also known as DNA profiling or DNA fingerprinting --
relies on the unique pattern of an individual's deoxyribonucleic
acid, the long, twisted chain found in all living cells that
carries a person's genetic code.
</P>
<P>
By analyzing four or five segments of a strand of DNA extracted
from a splash of blood, a scrap of skin or a drop of semen,
scientists can convincingly tie -- or definitively exclude -- a
suspect to a crime scene by comparing his DNA to that found at the
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
At issue is not the widely acknowledged scientific validity of
DNA typing, which two prominent critics called ``possibly the most
powerful innovation in forensics since the development of
fingerprinting'' a century ago.
</P>
<P>
There is no argument when DNA patterns from a crime scene do not
match a suspect's -- a result in roughly 30 percent of DNA test
cases that is considered definitive and usually leads to a speedy
exoneration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the technique has been embroiled in controversy since its
use was pioneered in Florida in 1987 because its aura of scientific
infallibility has an overwhelming impact on juries in life or death
criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
Two issues have fueled much of that debate: how to calculate the
odds that a suspect's DNA might coincidentally match someone else's
and the quality of the work performed by laboratories doing the
testing.
</P>
<P>
Because these issues are highly technical, the law in California
requires that the prosecution show that the statistical and
laboratory methods in question are ``generally accepted'' by the
scientific community -- an ambiguous standard that has provoked
endless debate.
</P>
<P>
Because it was the first DNA typing technique to be widely used
in court, the legal battle of the past decade has concerned itself
primarily with RFLP testing, otherwise known as restriction
fragment length polymorphism.
</P>
<P>
The weeks-long RFLP process involves chemically cutting a DNA
strand to examine four or five points where individual variations
are the greatest. Technicians then can develop a unique profile for
comparison purposes.
</P>
<P>
RFLP testing is considered the most definitive type of blood
testing, because it can reduce the odds of a coincidental match
between a suspect and someone else to a very small number.
</P>
<P>
But just how small has been the subject of a rancorous debate,
with estimates that have ranged up to 1 in 739 billion -- the kind
of numbers fiercely resisted by defense attorneys because of their
enormous impact on a jury.
</P>
<P>
``Once the scientists get up there and do their little spiel,
it's a foregone conclusion (the jury) will accept it,'' said James
Farley, the defense attorney in a 1989 Ventura, Calif. murder case
that set a precedent for the use of DNA testing in the state.
</P>
<P>
The continuing scientific debate over whether substantial
genetic variations between ethnic subpopulations affected the odds
of a match led the National Research Council to appoint a panel of
experts to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a landmark 1992 report, the NRC panel endorsed DNA testing in
general and proposed a compromise known as the modified ceiling
principle, an intentionally conservative and somewhat arbitrary
statistical method that placed an upper limit on the odds of a
random match.
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles prosecutors have had great success in using
in the ceiling principle in trial courts, the NRC report failed to
halt the debate or persuade appellate courts in some cases that DNA
testing fully met the necessary ``general acceptance'' standard.
</P>
<P>
Simpson's attorneys argue that there still is no generally
accepted method for calculating the odds of a match because
existing methods don't take into consideration significant genetic
variations among ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Even the ceiling principle is the subject of a ``raging
controversy'' in part because some critics claim it may not be
conservative enough, making DNA evidence appear more convincing
than it should, the Simpson team argues.
</P>
<P>
``Can anyone seriously argue that the ceiling principle is
generally accepted ... when prominent geneticists and statisticians
are comparing it to the `flat earth theory,' calling it
`pseudo-statistical,' saying it `has no rational basis' and calling
for it to be `buried,' '' the Simpson motion said.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, California
appellate courts have ruled on both sides of the issue. The Soto
case, decided in November, found RFLP tests ``highly reliable and
relevant'' on the basis that the ceiling rule is generally
accepted.
</P>
<P>
The case for general acceptance got another boost when Lander
and Budowle jointly endorsed the ceiling principle, a development
noted by the 4th District Court of Appeal in the Soto case.
</P>
<P>
``Considering they were clearly two of the most vocal advocates
of opposing camps on the forensic use of DNA, their mutual
declaration that the dispute is resolved in the scientific
community clearly carries great weight,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
Simpson's attorneys also attack RFLP typing on the grounds that
there is no meaningful way to determine whether the labs doing the
testing are making errors that could affect the tests' outcome.
</P>
<P>
It makes no sense to talk about a one-in-a-million chance that
anyone other than the suspect was at the crime scene if the lab
makes a mistake in one of every 100 cases, the Simpson team argues.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
``The true error rate of all the laboratories is unknown and
unknowable based on currently available data. Consequently, the
value of DNA evidence they offer is impossible to evaluate and
therefore inadmissible,'' Simpson's brief says.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argue that a lab's error rate goes to the weight the
jury should give test results, rather than to their admissibility --
although they are quick to note that the two labs doing most of
their testing undergo regular quality control checks.
</P>
<P>
The decision to use two labs also is aimed squarely at defense
arguments.
</P>
<P>
``There are experts who hold that you can eliminate the
statistical issue'' by conducting multiple tests, Deputy District
Attorney Lisa Kahn, now on maternity leave, told Science magazine
in September.
</P>
<P>
And by sending samples to more than one lab, ``you can pretty
much blow the possibility of a laboratory error out the window,''
Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have served notice they will oppose any
prosecution attempt to present the joint odds of a match on two or
more DNA tests on the grounds that such statistics are unsupported
by any published research.
</P>
<P>
The record on PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests is far
less complete, in large part because the technology did not come
into widespread use until as late as 1991.
</P>
<P>
PCR typing, a sort of molecular copying process, zeroes in on a
particular DNA marker -- or set of markers -- and copies them
hundreds of thousands of times, producing a large enough sample to
make typing possible.
</P>
<P>
Less definitive and yielding much smaller odds for a
coincidental match than the RFLP test, PCR can be used on degraded
blood, semen or saliva samples that are in such poor condition or
so small that RFLP testing isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the statistical and quality control concerns that
also apply to RFLP typing, the defense opposes the use of PCR tests
on the grounds that they remain almost entirely untested, both in
court and in the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
``The forensic use of these techniques by the laboratories are
barely known to the scientific community, much less generally
accepted,'' Simpson argues in court papers. ``The prosecution's
burden at this hearing is very heavy indeed.''
</P>
<P>
Further, the peculiar vulnerability of PCR tests to
contamination, both when the samples are being collected and when
the testing is being done in lab, makes the results inherently
unreliable, the defense team claims.
</P>
<P>
To buttress their case, defense attorneys cite the opinion of
Kary Mullis, the La Jolla, Calif., biologist who won a 1993 Nobel
prize for inventing the PCR technique, that it should only be used
to exclude suspects, not tie them to a crime.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors base their case for allowing PCR tests in court on
the relatively small number of rulings in state courts nationwide,
including recent decisions by the supreme courts of Washington and
Virginia to admit PCR typing.
</P>
<P>
Although PCR tests have been admitted by California trial
courts, there are no appellate rulings on the issue in this state.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 Virginia case, which resulted in the execution of
Timothy Spencer for murder and rape, the state Supreme Court upheld
the validity of one kind of PCR testing performed by Edward Blake
of Forensic Science Associates -- the consultant hired by the
Simpson defense team.
</P>
<P>
In the Washington case, decided in October, the state Supreme
Court ruled that PCR typing was generally accepted by the
scientific community and ruled that potential contamination and
other problems ``are either detectable or preventable.''
</P>
<P>
``No known appellate court decision has disapproved the
admissibility of PCR-based typing results,'' prosecutors note.
</P>
<P>
The lack of judicial review in connection with PCR testing will
make it a tougher call for Ito, said Southwestern's Raeder.
</P>
<P>
``There are some real question marks as to PCR ... I think Ito
will be faced with a decision that will trouble him more because of
the lack of appellate support,'' the law professor said.

THE WORLD SHIFTED, BUT NOT MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON  (BC-MEXICO-CHANGE-ART-760(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico has this in common with Orange County,
Calif., and with derivatives plungers and other big losers in 1994:
It failed to respond quickly when the economic world around it
began to change, or to realize how risky its economic strategy was
until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's risks were built into a strategy of luring investors
with high interest rates and a narrow currency-trading range,
international economists here have concluded.
</P>
<P>
That strategy paid off handsomely from 1991 to 1993, as foreign
investors who found a limited number of attractive places to put
their money during a global recession poured money into Mexican
bonds and notes paying 15 percent interest and bought millions of
shares in the fast-rising Mexican stock market.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans spent the money buying far more goods from abroad than
the country could pay for with the proceeds from its exports --
running trade deficits three times as large as the biggest American
deficits of the 1980s, if the sizes of the two economies are taken
into account.
</P>
<P>
The strategy flew in the face of advice from officials of the
International Monetary Fund. The result, as President Ernesto
Zedillo Ponce de Leon acknowledged in a speech last week, has been
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
The changes in the economic world that proved so devastating to
Mexico's strategy came from a multitude of sources, at home and
abroad. The Federal Reserve's decision in February to begin driving
up interest rates made it more attractive for many to invest in the
United States, rather than Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Many other nations' economies began to emerge from recession and
compete for international investment in 1994. And political
violence in Mexico made loans and stock purchases there seem
riskier.
</P>
<P>
When the money stopped flowing in, the Mexican government spent
close to $20 billion in six months to defend the peso's value. When
reserves ran low, top officials were forced to abandon the
centerpiece of their economic policy: a guarantee that no matter
what happened, a fistful of pesos would hold its value in dollars.
The peso has since lost roughly 30 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
International Monetary Fund officials refuse to claim
vindication. Financial analysts have been more outspoken.
</P>
<P>
``If the Mexican authorities had followed more closely the
exchange-rate readjustment suggested by the IMF models and
research, there wouldn't have been the chaos you saw in the
markets,'' said Gregory Fossedal, a writer in Arlington, Va., who
follows the IMF closely.
</P>
<P>
Mexico followed much, but not all, of the advice dispensed by
the IMF, the World Bank and other international economic
organizations. It sold state-owned enterprises to private buyers.
It balanced the budget. And it eliminated trade barriers, most
notably through the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took
effect a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But the government chose not to run the risk of social turmoil
from devaluing the peso, which would have made popular foreign
goods more expensive at home.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices in Mexico rose 27.9 percent from the end of 1991
through the middle of this year. Yet the value of the peso in
dollars fell only 9.4 percent during this period. For would-be
foreign buyers with dollars to spend, the slightly cheaper currency
was not nearly enough to offset the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Evidence that the peso needed to fall further was visible in
stores in south Texas this fall. Throngs of Mexican shoppers were
coming across the border because the prices were often cheaper than
at home.
</P>
<P>
The result was an immense trade deficit, reaching 8 percent of
Mexico's economic output in 1994. The rule of thumb commonly used
by the IMF and other international economic organizations is that a
developing country's trade deficit should not exceed its economic
growth rate. Mexico's annual growth has ranged from 1 to 3 percent
in the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Such large deficits lead inevitably to disaster, said a senior
economist at an international economic organization.

<P>
A 1989 letter from the IMF to the Mexican government warned that
if nothing were done, the trade balance, broadly measured to
include some financial flows, would double by 1994. But Mexico
allowed its line of credit at the IMF to lapse in May 1993 -- which
cut it free from the fund's advice, but also from its money.
</P>
<P>
Still, Mexican policy-makers had reason for optimism as a result
of the successful negotiation and approval in 1993 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement. The accord prompted foreign
investors to pour more money into the country. But as Zedillo
pointed out in his speech on Thursday, most of that money went into
stocks and bonds that could be quickly sold if confidence faltered.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the United States has sustained big trade deficits
for many years and relied heavily on foreign investment in American
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
One difference is that the American trade deficits have stayed
under 3 percent of economic output. Another is that the United
States does not try to fix the value of the dollar to other
currencies, allowing it constantly to rise and fall against other
money in markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1993, foreign investors in Mexico were spending
six times as much adding to their portfolios of Mexican stocks and
bonds as to build factories or buy controlling stakes in Mexican
companies. These stock and bond investors proved fickle, IMF
figures show.
</P>
<P>
After a peasant insurgency began in a southern state last
January and the front-running presidential candidate was
assassinated in March, the pace of these investments slowed
severely -- by 86 percent in three months.
</P>
<P>
Mexico tried until Dec. 22 to maintain a minimum value in U.S.
currency for the peso, through the use of a trading band whose
lower limit declined at a very slow, steady rate.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the recent plunge, the government had effectively
guaranteed that anyone who wanted to sell 100 pesos could get $29
for them -- 29 cents apiece. It would go into the market and buy
pesos at this price if no one else chose to.
</P>
<P>
When Mexicans and foreigners wanted to sell pesos for dollars
this autumn, the Mexican government became the biggest buyer. In
the last two months alone, it reportedly spent more than $10
billion buying pesos.
</P>
<P>
By late last month, the central bank's hoard of foreign currency
had fallen dangerously low. The government lowered its guarantee
level -- the process of devaluation -- to $25 for 100 pesos.
</P>
<P>
A day later, with central bank reserves at just $6 billion, the
government abandoned the guarantee entirely, allowing the peso to
trade freely in the currency markets. By the close of trading last
Tuesday, 100 pesos were worth only $17.54, though their value had
bounced back to $19.72 by the end of trading on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Conway, an associate professor of economics at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who specializes in the
Mexican economy, said Mexico did not appear to have learned from
past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, as in 1993, Mexico abandoned its line of
credit with the International Monetary Fund and pursued a strategy
of fast economic growth that included huge trade deficits financed
with foreign money.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, as in 1994, the outcome was a collapse in the peso and
the need for an international rescue.
</P>
<P>
The parallels, Conway said, suggest that in each case Mexican
officials ``were perhaps too hasty in cutting their ties to the
financial institutions that got them where they were.''

THE DNA HEARING: AN EXPLANATION OF TERMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES  (BC-SIMPSON-GLANCE-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is an explanation of some of the terms and
key legal cases that will be cited during the coming court hearing
on DNA evidence in the O.J. Simpson case:
</P>
<P>
-- People v. Axell: The first appellate decision on DNA evidence
in California. The 1991 decision by the Los Angeles-based 2nd
District Court of Appeal upheld the use of RFLP testing.
</P>
<P>
-- People v. Barney: This 1992 decision by the San
Francisco-based 1st District Court of Appeal ruled that RFLP
testing was not admissible because of a lack of general acceptance
by the scientific community. This finding was based in large part
on a 1991 article in Science magazine that criticized the
methodology used in interpreting tests results.
</P>
<P>
-- People v. Wallace This 1993 opinion by the 1st District Court
of Appeals affirmed the earlier Barney decision and ruled RFLP
testing was not admissible.
</P>
<P>
-- People v. Soto: The most recent appellate decision in
California. This Nov. 22, 1994 decision by the San Diego,
Calif.-based 4th District Court of Appeal upheld the use of RFLP
testing on the basis that it is generally accepted by scientists.
</P>
<P>
-- DNA: Shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material
found inhuman chromosomes that carries the coded messages of
heredity unique to each individual. DNA can be extracted from
samples of blood, semen, saliva, skin or hair follicles found at
the scene of a crime, then compared to DNA drawn from a suspect to
determine if there is a ``match.''
-- Kelly-Frye: Named for the California cases that established the
legal principles involved. A Kelly-Frye hearing is held to
determine if scientific evidence should be presented to a jury. One
of the tests of admissibility is whether the scientific test or
method used is ``generally accepted'' by the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
-- PCR: The polymerase chain reaction test, a sort of molecular
copier, uses an instrument called the thermal cycler to copy a DNA
fragment hundreds of thousands of times. In two hours, about 1
million copies can be created that enable scientists to determine
in which of 21 population groups the genetic sample falls. Less
precise than RFLP testing, the PCR technique can be used on samples
that are too small or degraded for RFLP analysis.
</P>
<P>
-- RFLP: Considered the most definitive of DNA tests, restriction
fragment length polymorphism is also the most time-consuming.
Results can take up to two months. This procedure involves cutting
the DNA with an enzyme and placing the fragments in gel, where the
strands are separated by size. The DNA then is attached to a
membrane where radioactive probes are attached to the strands and a
series of sequential X-rays taken. Three to five ``windows'' in the
DNA strands where individual variations are greatest then are
examined to develop a profile used for comparison purposes.

WELFARE DEBATE WILL RE-EXAMINE CORE ASSUMPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON  (BC-WELFARE-DEBATE-575(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A great debate is about to begin over one of the
major premises of America's social welfare policy: that low-income
people have legal rights to government aid guaranteeing a minimum
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Republicans who will take control of Congress on
Wednesday contend that welfare, Medicaid and food stamps should be
stripped of their status as open-ended ``entitlements.'' Instead,
they say, Congress should appropriate fixed amounts of money each
year for those programs, whose size would no longer increase
automatically when, for example, a recession put more people out of
work.
</P>
<P>
Neither Democrats nor Republicans are proposing to make
significant changes in the largest entitlement program, Social
Security, or to withdraw the entitlement status of Medicare,
although the money spent on those two programs dwarfs the spending
on welfare and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the battle lines have been drawn over the use of
entitlements to guarantee a minimum standard of living for the
poor. That struggle transcends the debate over specific Republican
proposals that would, for example, increase the use of orphanages,
impose stringent work requirements on welfare recipients and
eliminate aid to the children of young unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
Here is the outlook:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration is reassessing the whole question
of entitlements, is receptive to some changes and has not decided
on a strategy for dealing with Republican proposals to restructure
the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
-- Nonpartisan experts believe that Congress may, for the first
time, limit federal Medicaid spending, which has doubled in four
years, reaching $82 billion in 1994. Medicaid provides health care
for 33 million low-income people; Medicare finances health care for
36 million people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
-- Congress will consider giving states a lump-sum payment, or
block grant, to help poor people now entitled to benefits under the
main cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
Block grants would be a radical departure because they would
eliminate individual entitlement to benefits and would give states
more flexibility in deciding how to use the money.
</P>
<P>
-- The food stamp program is perhaps the most secure of the major
benefit programs for poor people. House Republicans want to put it
into a block grant with other food and nutrition programs, but they
expect resistance because food stamps have support from a
middle-class constituency that includes farmers, grocers and the
food industry generally.
</P>
<P>
The struggle will challenge Democrats, in the administration and
in Congress, to explain why entitlement programs were created and
why they should be continued.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who is on the Budget Committee,
said: ``We have to get these programs off autopilot. They should be
subject to annual appropriations. Entitlements have taken away the
power of the people, through Congress, to decide where money is
spent each year.''
</P>
<P>
Congress would need more control over spending to comply with a
proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced
federal budget, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say the welfare and food stamp programs serve a
valuable economic purpose, infusing money into a state when
recession hits, unemployment rises and more families need
assistance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reps. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Ways and Means
Committee who is trying to coordinate the Democratic strategy on
welfare legislation, said he strongly believed that states should
have more flexibility in designing programs, but he worried about
Republican efforts to replace entitlement programs. ``What would
happen in times of recession?'' he asked in an interview. ``You
can't repeal economic cycles.''
</P>
<P>
Another Democrat, Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, said entitlement programs responded
automatically to economic and demographic changes.
</P>
<P>
Shays countered, ``That's a good argument, but in the process
we're going bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
In an entitlement program, the government has a legal obligation
to pay benefits to all applicants who meet eligibility criteria set
by U.S. law. The formulas for deciding who gets how much stay the
same from year to year unless Congress votes to change them.
</P>
<P>
If the demand for aid exceeds expectations, Congress must
somehow come up with more money, by borrowing, raising taxes or
cutting other items in the budget.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Congress appropriates specific amounts each year
for discretionary spending programs, which include defense, medical
research, law enforcement, Head Start and job training.
</P>
<P>
Entitlement programs account for slightly more than half of all
federal spending, roughly $800 billion of $1.5 trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
The great middle-class entitlements, Social Security and
Medicare, which pay benefits regardless of financial need, dwarf
the programs for low-income people -- the government spent $475
billion on Social Security and Medicare in 1994, compared with a
total of $125 billion on Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
food stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
But Social Security, which both parties have found to be a
volatile issue, is off the table, and Congress is not considering
changes in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
The roots of these programs run deep. Welfare, under the name
Aid to Dependent Children, was part of the Social Security Act in
1935. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Food Stamp Act in
1964. Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965.
</P>
<P>
While committed to the overall goals of those programs, the
administration has not decided whether or how to defend their
status as entitlements. White House officials are mulling that
question as they prepare for a conference on welfare with governors
and members of Congress from both parties in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said President Clinton, a former
governor, was sympathetic to the governors' pleas for more
flexibility in using federal money.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would defend the entitlement status of welfare and
Medicaid, Avis La Velle, an assistant secretary of health and human
services, said: ``No, I can't. There is a re-evaluation going on
throughout the department as to the whole concept of entitlement
programs. It's just not smart for us to take an advocacy position
one way or another. The ground is shifting under our feet.''
</P>
<P>
Levin said Democrats in Congress and the administration had ``no
clear strategy'' for dealing with the Republican proposals at this
time. ``It's important for us to develop one quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, said that if lawmakers wanted to slow the growth of welfare
programs, they could do so without eliminating the entitlement to
benefits. For example, he said, Congress could restrict eligibility
or make benefits less generous. Such changes could save substantial
amounts of money, but the government would still have a legal
obligation to pay benefits to any applicants who met the criteria.
</P>
<P>
``The notion that we are incapable of selectively modifying
entitlement programs is just wrong,'' Reischauer said.
</P>
<P>
There is fierce competition for money among domestic programs,
and it is likely to intensify this year. Current law imposes an
annual limit on all discretionary spending through 1998, and
President Clinton says he wants to maintain the ceiling at current
levels in 1999 and 2000, with no allowance for inflation. Rep. John
R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is in line to become chairman of the House
Budget Committee, says he wants to reduce the spending limits.
</P>
<P>
If a benefit program loses its status as an entitlement, it
would have to compete with all the other domestic programs for
which Congress appropriates money each year. And that, many
Republicans say, is exactly what should happen.

REBELS IN MEXICO HOLD A SUBDUED CELEBRATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GUADALUPE TEPEYAC, Mexico  (BC-MEXICO-REBELS-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the great amphitheater carved
from the rain forest to receive partisans of the peasant guerrillas
with headquarters here, the rough-hewn benches where thousands once
sat were nearly empty as the New Year began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The genial small-town newspaper publisher whom the insurgents
call the true governor of the ``rebel state of Chiapas'' had
brought some friends to celebrate the first anniversary of their
uprising, but most of them fit into a single pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
A few hundred villagers and uniformed soldiers ringed the podium
from which a band played and masked rebel officers spoke; local
girls were still scarce enough that when the marimbas started up,
the young soldiers had to dance in shifts.
</P>
<P>
``Together, we fulfilled our mission to show the bad government
that there was poverty in this land of Chiapas, and that there was
poverty in all of Mexico,'' a rebel commander known as Tacho said
as midnight approached Saturday, recalling the morning that his
forces seized a handful of remote towns and the country's
attention. ``We did not surrender. We did not sell out.''
</P>
<P>
Yet a year after the Zapatista National Liberation Army stormed
into view, changing Mexico's course abruptly and challenging a
model of economic development widely admired in Latin America,
there was an air of loneliness, even desperation to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
One might have expected otherwise. Less than two weeks ago,
after threatening for months to break a longstanding cease-fire,
the Zapatistas helped to plunge the country into an economic and
political crisis by announcing that they had broken through
government lines and moved into dozens of municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the rebels and their supporters only blocked a
handful of highways and briefly occupied a few undefended towns was
lost on investors who withdrew about $1 billion from the country.
This contributed to the already heavy pressure on the peso, and the
government devalued the currency the next day. By last week,
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was urging new peace talks
and pulling his troops from rebel areas to show good faith.
</P>
<P>
As the Zapatistas marked the first year of their war, however,
their leaders seemed to be viewing the prospect of new negotiations
with skepticism bordering on scorn.
</P>
<P>
Even as they congratulated themselves for drawing new attention
to the plight of Mexico's Indian peasants, rebel leaders sounded
ever more angry that their demands for sweeping changes in the
country's political system and economic policy were not being
heard.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos, rejecting the
idea of talks, demanded early on Sunday that the president's
month-old government be replaced.
</P>
<P>
``We call on all the political and social forces of the country,
on all honest Mexicans, on all those who struggle for the
democratization of the country to form a Movement for National
Liberation,'' he said in a statement he titled the Third
Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle.
</P>
<P>
The movement, he added, should ``struggle by all means and at
all levels for the installation of a government of transition, a
new constituent assembly, a new magna carta and the destruction of
the ruling-party system.''
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of dozens of Mexican and foreign reporters,
Subcommander Marcos did not appear at the ceremony himself.
Instead, his comrades played a scratchy tape recording in which he
read three communiques over what he described as a clandestine
rebel radio station; no such station was previously known to exist.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, he suggested that the new movement be formed
from the remains of the National Democratic Convention, the loose
amalgam of social organizations and leftist political groups that
trekked to the rebel capital here just before Mexico's presidential
elections in August to show support for the Zapatistas. And he
proposed that the leftist candidate in the presidential race,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, take the lead in the movement.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas did not answer the invitation on Sunday, but he is not
expected to emerge to lead a new movement.
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, Marcos has acknowledged that the rebels
were badly disappointed by their failure to ignite wider political
support for their demands of new rights for Mexican Indians, wide
economic and social changes in Chiapas and political reforms
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
To hear Marcos, the insurgents draw new hope from the economic
turmoil that has followed the peso's sharp devaluation. ``The
economic crisis awakened Mexicans from the sweet and stupefying
dream of entrance into the First World,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet in the remote swath of southern Mexico that the army has
effectively ceded to the Zapatistas for the last year, the
situation seemed also to be wearing at the faithful.
</P>
<P>
Though market prices have nearly doubled over the last year for
coffee, the region's most important cash crop, many poor farmers
say they will have little profit because they could not buy
pesticides for their plants. Asked whether they would be joining
the rebel army, several teen-agers at the celebration demurred:
their friends in arms eat little but tortillas, they said.
</P>
<P>
What is hardest, said a 30-year-old man who gave his name as
Miguel, is that for most of the last year it has been painfully
difficult to get through army roadblocks even to the closest town.
</P>
<P>
``People are getting angrier here,'' said a 20-year-old rebel
named Eliver. ``People do not want to fight again, but they will.
No one believes in the dialogue. We have been talking for a year,
and nothing here has changed.''

AT AN AIDS FACILITY, A NURSE FIGHTS HER OWN GOOD FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-AIDS-WORKER-2TAKES-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim G. came back one Wednesday but he was changed --
thinner, quieter, diffident. He had been shooting up a combination
of heroin and cocaine that had damaged one of his kidneys and
impaired his memory.
</P>
<P>
Deborah Sollod, the clinical nurse manager at the Robert
Mapplethorpe Residential AIDS Treatment Facility, stood behind Tim
G.'s wheelchair in the narrow hallway of the brownstone and tried
to reassure him.
</P>
<P>
``Hi, Angie,'' Ms. Sollod said to Angela A., who stood in the
hallway. She was an increasingly paranoid 36-year-old recovering
crack addict who barely remembered her four children. ``How are
you, sweetie?''
</P>
<P>
Angela A. rolled her eyes.
</P>
<P>
A man with a lesion on top of his head complained that the
dining room was cold, but his real complaint, Ms. Sollod said, was
his AIDS, his cancer and his loneliness.
</P>
<P>
And so began another day for Ms. Sollod, a 34-year-old
registered nurse who leaves suburbia each dawn to travel into the
heart of the great plague of the 20th century. By 7 a.m. she enters
her claustrophobic basement office in the East Side brownstone that
is home to 15 women and 13 men with AIDS. Her days end 10 hours
later.
</P>
<P>
In every major city, health care workers like Ms. Sollod
increasingly deal with the new AIDS patient -- a poor drug addict
with a range of social problems. For the patients, it is yet
another crisis in lives spent scraping the bottom of their
humanity. For health care professionals and social workers it has
changed the trajectories of their cases from concerns about medical
bills and miracle cures to include concerns about food stamps, drug
treatment and housing.
</P>
<P>
In New York City, the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic with over
70,000 cases, most new cases involve intravenous drug users, not
men who have sex with other men. Unlike the middle-class gay white
men who brought AIDS to the attention of the nation, the new
patients are increasingly black and Hispanic people, and their
illness is often compounded not only by drug addiction but also by
poverty and emotional problems and estrangement from family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
And for those who work to ease their suffering, the disease
takes a toll of a different kind. Turnover and burnout are high in
AIDS nursing homes and in AIDS wards in hospitals in New York City
and across the country. The Mapplethorpe staff members talk
constantly among themselves about the strain of what they do. Some
see therapists, some find other escapes.
</P>
<P>
``It's not pleasant being around people you know are going to
die,'' Ms. Sollod said the other day. ``Personally, I have a hard
time with it. I don't like to go visit them in the hospital. You
fall in love with them. Just because you're a nurse doesn't mean
it's easy.
</P>
<P>
``If I can make this one day a happy day, then I am pleased,''
she said. ``Many have never had a happy day in their lives. If
taking them to a Christmas show can make a difference -- they've
probably passed Radio City Music Hall for 20 years on their way to
get high.''
</P>
<P>
Beth Israel Medical Center built the long-term-care residence
with the help of $1 million from the Robert Mapplethorpe
Foundation, established by the photographer, who died of AIDS in
1989.
</P>
<P>
The center, one of about half a dozen in New York City, is like
a nursing home in that it serves people too sick to live on their
own but not sick enough to go into the hospital. They receive
medical care and psychotherapy and their drug treatment is
monitored. Ms. Sollod took the job, she said, both because of a
desire to help and because it offered a chance to go into
management. She had previously been a case manager in neo-natal
intensive care at Beth Israel and a staff nurse there, among other
jobs.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't think of it as working with AIDS patients, I thought
of it as working with people,'' Ms. Sollod said. ``This was like a
stepping stone to the AIDS community. They need people. There
aren't a lot of people dedicating their career to it.''
</P>
<P>
The world Ms. Sollod has entered is far different from the one
in which she was reared, as a police officer's daughter in the
bosom of a close Irish-Italian family on a quiet street in Staten
Island. And she says she has learned that the universe inside the
six floors of the Mapplethorpe brownstone is not quite real to
those outside.
</P>
<P>
There are many nights she goes home and cries, she said, but
what keeps her going is the belief that she can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
The 9 a.m. staff meeting at Mapplethorpe is a roll-call of woes.
Ms. Sollod, who is expecting her first child in July, sits at the
head of the table in the dining room and eats a pear to battle
nausea, curling her beautifully manicured orange fingernails around
the fruit.
</P>
<P>
There are eight staff members at the meeting and the details
snatched from the patients' lives are intimate. Who has coughing
pains, who has heavy menstrual periods, who has a family member
trying to smuggle in some marijuana.

One patient's test shows that his brain is shrinking. Another is
vomiting up methadone. A male patient refuses to allow a female
dentist to examine him. There is a suspicion that one of the women
is not taking her anti-psychotic medication, because she has been
accusing the staff of plotting against her. There is concern about
the continuing relationship between two residents who apparently
lived together before coming to Mapplethorpe.

``The same cardboard box?'' deadpans R. Steven Fox, a
psychotherapist with twinkling eyes behind thick glasses and blond
hair caught up in a long ponytail. Fox said later that he jokes so
he will not be overwhelmed by the sorrow he witnesses. He also sees
a therapist and works out.
</P>
<P>
``If you don't laugh you're not going to make it through the
day,'' Ms. Sollod said.
</P>
<P>
Right after the staff meeting the residents gather in the dining
room. Ms. Sollod, wearing a flowing flower-print dress and black
combat boots, goes to the front of the room and announces: ``Yes,
I'm having a baby.'' There is applause and smiles of delight. Many
of the residents have children, too.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know how I kept it from you for the four weeks I
knew,'' she says. ``It'll be the first Mapplethorpe baby, so don't
keep me stressed out.'' It's a joke, big time. Ms. Sollod said she
had no special fears now that she is pregnant. She said she had
always been very straightforward about telling patients to practice
basic hygiene: not to kiss her when they have a cold, to blow their
noses carefully, and not to pick their fingers until they bleed. A
few residents have sex with one another, and Ms. Sollod admonishes
them to wear condoms.
</P>
<P>
``Don't smoke on the way over there,'' she said to a patient who
was going to Beth Israel Medical Center for an X-ray. Ms. Sollod
quit cold turkey herself. ``Take some tissues. You're wiping your
nose with your hands.''
</P>
<P>
To some, Ms. Sollod is a big sister, to others a mother. One of
her favorite residents is a 66-year-old man who got AIDS from sex
with prostitutes. They find great comfort in watching films
together on the American Movie Classics cable channel.
</P>
<P>
``He could easily be my grandfather,'' Ms. Sollod said. ``Our
backgrounds are very similar. I grew up Irish-Italian; we had
family dinner every Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
Since she got the job at Mapplethorpe when it opened last
October, she has worked every single holiday. She raids her
husband's clothes closet for hand-me-downs for residents and even
has a hairdresser friend come in to offer solace through shampoo.
</P>
<P>
She and Joseph Sollod, a computer specialist at Merrill Lynch,
recently moved into a big house in Somerset, N.J. She is working on
a master's degree at Hunter College in Manhattan that will make her
a clinical nurse specialist in maternal/child health. Her dream is
to open a house just for pregnant women with HIV and their babies.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Sollod is serene and matter-of-fact. Neither her tone nor
her facial expression changes when she switches from ordering a
bagel with cream cheese to talking about a 69-year-old resident who
needs his leg amputated because of an infection. Ms. Sollod dresses
his leg every morning, which is also the time to check his state of
mind. This is a long-distance run, with no time to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
There is a lot of talking. The patients talk to Ms. Sollod about
all kinds of things: their childhoods, why they started using
drugs, how they believed they got AIDS. Most of them have a hard
time believing they are going to die.
</P>
<P>
``I have a strong religious belief that God heals my body and
could possibly find a cure,'' said Angela A., who says she got AIDS
from sex. She said she found out in 1990 that she was HIV positive.
Like all the other residents, she spoke on the condition that her
full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
Eddie L., a 46-year-old who looks like someone awakened from a
bad dream, wants to go back to school to be a substance abuse
counselor. He wears a 32-year-old tattoo that says ``Born to Raise
Hell,'' with the word ``Hell'' almost completely faded. He began
shooting heroin in the late 1960s and has spent 18 years in prison
for armed robbery, breaking and entering, and car theft.
</P>
<P>
``This place is teaching me that some days I'll have bad days
but it's no reason to run off and stick a needle in my arm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He is not sure what happened to his family. He gave the virus to
a lover but he has heard that their daughter is O.K.
</P>
<P>
``I love Debbie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
It all comes down to drugs. There is the constant apprehension
that someone like Tim G. will go out and get high -- he was gone
several weeks -- which will only accelerate the inevitable
deterioration of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
`'I'm bad,'' Ms. Sollod said the other day when asked how she
was. One of the residents had a urine sample that came back
positive for cocaine. Ms. Sollod just could not believe it. Her
eyes were teary.
</P>
<P>
``He was doing so good,'' she said. ``He said he didn't use
drugs. I want so bad to believe him.''
</P>
<P>
Ms. Sollod called an outside laboratory and was told that if the
test was positive for cocaine, then the patient probably used
cocaine. She wanted the urine tested again.
</P>
<P>
It was time for the bedroom check. All the bedrooms are checked
for neatness. Ms. Sollod can also see how people are holding
together.
</P>
<P>
``You O.K., honey?'' Ms. Sollod asked a woman stretched across
her bed. ``Just sleeping?'' The woman mumbled that she was all
right, but Ms. Sollod said later that she was depressed.
</P>
<P>
Another woman had a bad cold she could not shake and Ms. Sollod
warned her that she must be tested for strep throat.
</P>
<P>
``Stop sucking that stuff up,'' Ms. Sollod said. ``Blow your
nose.''
</P>
<P>
After the bedroom rounds were completed, Ms. Sollod walked down
to her office. Her most pronounced pregnancy symptom so far is a
voracious appetite, so she took a break to eat.
</P>
<P>
``Debbie?'' came the tremulous voice of a patient outside her
door, popping the bubble of quiet.
</P>
<P>
``I'm here,'' Ms. Sollod said.

A PRAMATIC CONSERVATIVE: GEORGE ELMER PATAKI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALBANY, N.Y.  (BC-NY-PATAKI-PROFILE-659(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the friends he met at Yale College 31 years
ago, George E. Pataki was a garrulous, beer-loving freshman who
knew precisely where he stood on the political spectrum (to the
right), the name of the next president (Barry Goldwater) and what
he would become when he grew up (governor of New York State).
</P>
<P>
To the politicians he passed along the way to becoming the 53rd
governor of New York, Pataki was also a conservative, but often a
pragmatic one. His central beliefs did not stop him from working
with more moderate politicians or from moderating his own views on
difficult issues to achieve his goals. Taking over as governor of a
state facing a $5 billion budget deficit whose electorate he
described as angry and hungry for change, Pataki presented himself
Sunday as both a steadfast conservative determined to shrink
government, and a farmer's son who, like his idol Theodore
Roosevelt, cares more about getting things done than staying true
to dogma.
</P>
<P>
He comes into office at a time when national sentiment is also
for smaller government. Many a Republican rode that tide to victory
in November, but Pataki can claim to have arrived at this place by
sticking with some basic beliefs he learned long ago from his
father, the mailman and farmer.
</P>
<P>
``When government accepts responsibility for people, then people
no longer take responsibility for themselves,'' he said in his
inaugural address Sunday. ``We will begin where the people want us
to begin, reducing the size and cost of government.''
</P>
<P>
Since he was a teen-ager Pataki has been unwavering about the
political label he gave himself: when he defeated a better known
and ostensibly more popular classmate for senior class president of
Peekskill High School, he was already calling himself a ``small-c
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
By the time he reached Yale, he was recruiting volunteers for
the Goldwater campaign. He built his social life around campus
politics, becoming a leader of the Conservative Party at the Yale
Political Union and creating an informal club of like-minded
friends who each had a nickname ending with ``fus,'' as in ``for
the U.S.'' Pataki was Grufus, because he grew so tall.
</P>
<P>
Even as many of his peers drifted left in the 1960s, Pataki
joined pro-war demonstrations at Columbia Law School and became
known as the one guy willing to defend President Richard Nixon in
barroom debates.
</P>
<P>
When he entered the state Assembly in 1985, he joined a severely
outvoted Republican minority and saw only a handful of his bills
passed during his eight-year tenure. Yet he enthusiastically
endorsed the minority's political playbook, incorporating its main
ideas into his gubernatorial platform: cut taxes, reduce Medicaid
spending, put welfare recipients to work, strengthen criminal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Pataki also struck conservative poses that helped his career. In
the Republican-controlled Senate, he twice was the lone Republican
to vote against the state budget. Though the Senate leadership
punished him for his insubordination, he repeatedly cited those
votes as examples of his fiscal conservatism in his gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Connecting all those experiences was Pataki's belief that people
should stop looking to government to solve their problems. Pataki
summarized that philosophy in a 1985 television interview, but the
words could have been drawn from one of his 1965 Yale debates or
even his 1995 inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
``It's very important to stand on your own feet to the extent
that you can,'' he told an interviewer from the program ``Inside
Albany.'' ``To try to better yourself by seeking out employment or
education or anything else, instead of having the government come
deliver it to you.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
George Elmer Pataki was born on June 24 in Peekskill, and grew
up on the family vegetable farm. His father was a mail carrier who
rose to the level of manager. But he also managed the 15-acre farm
and occasionally worked a third job to support the family and save
for his two sons' college tuition. George, his older brother,
Louis, and 13 cousins who also lived on the farm were expected to
pull their weight by tilling fields, picking strawberries and
delivering produce to the farm stand.
</P>
<P>
``Picking, plowing, getting stomped by the work horses, that's
what we did,'' Louis Pataki said. ``It was not romantic. It was
work.''
</P>
<P>
In his steadiness, his unflappable demeanor and his work ethic,
Pataki resembles his father, friends say. ``His father was a calm
rock in the middle of everything,'' said Michael C. Finnegan,
Pataki's friend and counsel. ``In many respects, that's who George
Pataki is. In the middle of a catastrophe, he doesn't get
rattled.''
</P>
<P>
The son also inherited from the father, who now has Alzheimer's
disease and lives in a nursing home, a streak of political
pragmatism. Pataki tells a story about how during the Depression
his father was told he must register Democratic to get a post
office job. ``I don't think I should do it,'' said the elder
Pataki, who was then an independent. ``You're absolutely right,''
his wife replied. The next day, he registered Democratic and got
the job. ``Thank God,'' said his wife.
</P>
<P>
``They were always very apolitical,'' Pataki said. ``But they
had very strong values and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
His friends see parallels between that story and Pataki's
alliance with U.S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. ``Clearly their
relationship helped him get the nomination,'' said Mac Hansing, a
Yale friend. ``But that doesn't mean he will obediently do whatever
D'Amato wants. It was just political expedience.''

<TEXT>
<P>
Critics say there are many other cases in which Pataki's
positions seemed based on political expediency more than principle.
Though he opposed abortion during the 1980s, he called himself
``pro-choice'' in 1992 when he ran against State Senator Mary B.
Goodhue, his former mentor who was an advocate of a woman's right
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
During last year's campaign, he called for banning assault
weapons, yet voted against a Democratic gun-control measure last
April. And at Yale, he abstained in one of the most heated debates
of the year, over whether outside agitators did more harm than good
in the civil-rights movement.
</P>
<P>
Pataki cites the changes in his abortion stand as evidence that
he is open-minded, with an everyman's distaste for dogma. ``I am
not someone who doesn't reflect on the whole question of
abortion,'' he said in October. ``And I think most people do. It is
a tough decision not just for politicians, it is a very tough
personal decision for people.''
</P>
<P>
If Yale was an important proving ground for his philosophy, it
did little to change Pataki's style, friends say. Though he found
himself surrounded by prep school students and old wealth, he
continued to dress in faded jeans and flannel work shirts and to
frequent working-class bars.
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Jackson Jr., an old friend, recalls Pataki ``without
missing a beat'' pungently scolding a snobbish roommate who
denigrated Jackson's college, the University of Bridgeport. ``They
stopped being roommates later that year,'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
With his easy-going manner, Pataki never seemed as if he were
working hard, consistently scoring excellent grades although he
played much basketball and took long vacations to places like
Puerto Rico. ``He was easy to underestimate,'' said Edward W.
Hayes, a Manhattan lawyer who was at Columbia with Pataki. ``But
that's the biggest mistake you can make with him. He's very
focused. And he's got terrific will to win.''
</P>
<P>
Many of his rivals for the Republican nomination also
underestimated him, scoffing at his chances of unseating Gov. Mario
M. Cuomo. William D. Powers, the Republican state chairman, said he
first decided that Pataki's would win when he saw the candidate
early on a frigid morning last winter, trudging up a snow-swept
Albany street to use a phone at Republican headquarters because he
could not make campaign calls from his Senate office. ``There
aren't a lot of people who would leave the warmth of their Senate
offices in the winter,'' said Powers. ``It demonstrated his
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
At times, that commitment has faltered. On several occasions in
his career, including during a low point in last year's race,
Pataki has talked of returning to Peekskill to become a full-time
farmer.
</P>
<P>
But when it counted most last year, Pataki was unwavering in his
desire to win. Eight days from the election, when he had fallen
behind in most polls, Pataki made a command tour of his Manhattan
office.
</P>
<P>
``It made a palpable difference in morale,'' said Gary W.
Maloney, a campaign research consultant. ``Here's the man who's
seen a 6-point lead go to a 14-point deficit saying we're going to
win this. He reached inside himself and proved to everyone that he
was the man to replace Cuomo.''

YOUNG TROJANS TO GET TASTE OF A BIG-TIME BOWL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DALLAS  (BC-FBC-COTTON-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last one out of Lubbock get the lights.
</P>
<P>
There are overflowing dog dishes and mailboxes all over West
Texas today, because Texas Tech is in the Cotton Bowl for the first
time since it joined the Southwest Conference going on 34 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
That the Red Raiders play USC doesn't seem to have much
significance here, where football is heaven and Spike Dykes gets to
be God for a week.
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have gone largely unnoticed as the opponent in one
of the least-attractive Cotton Bowls since the game's inception in
1937. For the first time, neither team is ranked in the nation's
top 20 and the eight combined losses (7-3-1 by USC, 6-5 by Texas
Tech) are the most since Kentucky and TCU played in 1952.
</P>
<P>
This is just the sort of thing that has followed USC around for
the past several years, or at least since 1989, when it last played
in the Rose Bowl. If not for the indiscretions of Texas AM, the
Trojans would be playing the 10-0-1 Aggies today and the USC ticket
office might have sold more than the 5,000 seats it did.
</P>
<P>
The Trojans might have been back in the national eye rather than
fending off yet another Fresno State in yet another version of the
Freedom Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Not that the Cotton Bowl against Texas Tech does not have its
benefits. Forty-eight Trojans are freshmen or sophomores. This,
then, serves as their January bowl training wheels, a ride USC
coach John Robinson expects to take often as the decade goes on.
</P>
<P>
``We have an extremely young team,'' he said, ``one of the
youngest I've ever coached in terms of freshmen and new players
that are playing. For that, as you look into the future, the
opportunity to play in a major game, to go out of town and to be
exposed to the things that our players have been exposed to, is
really great. The chance to have an extra 10 or 12 days of practice
is also a very positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
Though a win here against underdog Texas Tech does not solve
Notre Dame, does not solve UCLA, it might further validate the
young players within the program. It might promote quarterback Rob
Johnson in the NFL draft. It might deepen USC's inroads in Texas
recruiting. A victory also would give Robinson his eighth of the
season, a total he reached in each of his first eight years over
his two terms at USC.
</P>
<P>
But, for a few hours anyway, it is only Texas Tech and USC, with
none of the past and none of the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
``We don't have the best of records,'' Dykes said, ``and we're
not the highest-ranked team to play in the Cotton Bowl, but,
hopefully, on Monday at noon, you're going to see a great football
game.''
</P>
<P>
The Red Raiders won only four of seven SWC games. When they won,
it typically was with defense and with quarterback Zebbie Lethridge
and tailback Byron Hanspard, both freshmen. They call their defense
the Blitz Brothers, and it had 34 sacks and, on running plays
alone, 65 tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
``When I look at them, I think of Washington State,'' said Mike
Riley, USC's offensive coordinator. ``When we played Washington
State, they were not overly big, but very aggressive, very quick,
and they were play makers.
</P>
<P>
``The scheme that they play reminds me of Arizona a little bit.
Those were two great defensive teams that we played, and they
remind me of them in different aspects.''
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that USC beat Washington State by 13 points
and Arizona by 17 in back-to-back games.

CHINA TAILORS MILITARY TO PROTECT INTERESTS IN SOUTH CHINA SEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING  (BC-CHINA-MILITARY-649(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Chinese diplomats talk of peaceful coexistence with
their Southeast Asian neighbors, China's military leaders are
refurbishing a portion of their large and antiquated military to
enforce claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea and its
resources, Chinese and Western experts say.
</P>
<P>
In this effort, Chinese military leaders have nurtured specific
industries to develop advanced weapons technology and are tailoring
their naval and air forces for the region, the experts say, even as
the country's overall level of military production is declining.
</P>
<P>
At stake are potentially vast oil reserves, minerals and fishing
grounds that intersect some of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
With energy demands surging along with the population, oil supplies
are falling behind in China, which in 1993 became a net importer of
oil for the first time. So any major oil discovery in the South
China Sea is likely to draw Beijing's immediate attention on
securing it.
</P>
<P>
A group of former American military leaders who visited China
last year has reported that China is forming a limited military
force ``capable of rapid response'' and designed to protect
``island claims in the South China Sea as a matter of national
priority.''
</P>
<P>
The group was led by former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara
and four recently retired four-star military officers, including,
David E. Jeremiah, a former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and James P. McCarthy, a former Deputy Commander of United
States forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although comprehensive military modernization remains a distant
goal for China, these and other experts say, Beijing has in recent
years built up its military in specific areas by:
</P>
<P>
-- Improving its ability to fight a sustained sea battle with its
fleet of surface warships, support vessels and submarine forces.
</P>
<P>
-- Negotiating with Russia for the purchase of a total of 72
advanced Su-27 attack aircraft capable of providing close air
support for naval operations at extended range. (The first 24
Su-27s were delivered in 1992 but negotiations over the terms for
the rest have been troublesome.)
</P>
<P>
-- Organizing a handful of marine units for amphibious assault
and training airborne forces for rapid deployment in Soviet-made
transport aircraft. (One such force is based on Hainan Island for
quick dispatch to the Spratlys and the Paracels, two island chains
in the South China Sea.)
</P>
<P>
-- Developing mobile, conventional-warhead missiles to terrorize
any foe within 1,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
``By the year 2005, they would like to achieve a core force of
500,000 to one million across their services who are fairly
modern,'' said one specialist on Chinese military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the recent efforts, however, this goal seems illusive
to other experts because China is still technologically
unsophisticated in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese warships, for example, have little or no effective air
defense, and their targeting radars cannot reach over the horizon.
China has no hope of financing aircraft-carrier development for at
least a decade. Its submarines are noisy and vulnerable and are
equipped with poorly functioning torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese air force has yet to produce a modern, supersonic
aircraft with all-weather air-to-air combat abilities. And China's
air defense system could not stop penetration by the French Mirage
2000 attack planes recently purchased by Taiwan, whose pilots get
more flight training hours in a month than Chinese pilots get in a
year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
``We are aware that our weaponry of all services is far behind
the present equipment of the United States,'' Adm. Liu Huaqing,
China's top military officer, told the McNamara group. ``We hope to
modernize, but the problem is that we have no resources; and if we
compete with economic needs, we will be in competition with the
economy, and that is not in China's interest.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Still, Chinese and Western specialists say, Beijing's limited
buildup is threatening to neighbors like Vietnam, which lost two
vessels in a clash with Chinese forces in 1988.
</P>
<P>
``The danger of what we have on the question of China's military
is that people are beginning to make the case that China is
benign,'' said James R. Lilley, a former ambassador to Beijing and
longtime CIA officer in Asia.
</P>
<P>
``China says it has no military objectives, that on the South
China Sea it wants to cooperate to find a diplomatic solution while
exploiting the resources, that there are no military solutions and
that China is focusing on the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that by all appearances, China's military buildup is
tightly focused on the South China Sea area, Lilley added: ``I'm
afraid the evidence tells us otherwise. And it is quite clear that
that is their objective in 10 to 20 years.''

Experts point out that Liu, a member of the ruling Politburo and
former chief of the navy, has been a leading advocate for seizing
the rich mineral and fishing grounds of the South China Sea to
support China's swelling population. The diet of China's
population, Liu once told the New China News Agency, will
increasingly require the protein supplied from fish. As
exploitation of sea-based resources becomes more important, he
added, China will need a modern navy. Indeed, China's consumption
of seafood has quadrupled since 1978.
</P>
<P>
In February 1992, the National People's Congress issued its
``Law on the Territorial Waters and their Contiguous Areas,'' which
laid claim to 80 percent of the South China Sea with a
horseshoe-shaped boundary that runs the length of Vietnam's
coastline and then swings southwest to waters off Malaysia, Brunei
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The law laid down regulations for transit through the area and
called for ``immediate eviction of foreign military vessels or
vessels owned by foreign governments and used for noncommercial
purposes that violate the laws and regulations'' of China. Seventy
percent of Japan's crude oil imports traverses the area.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the official Guangming Daily said 400 Chinese
scholars recently completed 10 years of research on the Spratly
Islands and ``proved historically'' that China ``discovered and the
developed the Spratly Islands.''
</P>
<P>
The Spratlys -- comprising 21 islands and atolls, 50 submerged
land spits and 28 partly submerged bits of rock and reef spread out
over 340,000 square miles -- ``are a sacred and inviolable part of
Chinese territory,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has never taken a position on the territorial
disputes in the South China Sea, which also involve claims by
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Brunei. By far the
most contentious dispute is between China and Vietnam, whose naval
forces clashed most recently in 1988 when Chinese warships sank two
Vietnamese vessels with the loss of more than 70 lives.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Premier Li Peng offered to put the sovereignty question
aside and called for joint development of oil resources by all the
claimants, but there were no takers.
</P>
<P>
In mid-1992, China contracted with a small American company, the
Crestone Energy Corp., to begin oil exploration off Vietnam's coast
near Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam replied last year by granting the
Mobil Oil Corp. drilling rights in adjacent waters.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the region say China and Vietnam pledged in
November to ``refrain from all acts that'' could ``broaden
conflicts'' or lead to the use of force in the region. But a state
visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Jiang Zemin did little to allay
Vietnam's concern about China's long-term intentions.
</P>
<P>
While future use of military force by Beijing in the South China
Sea is considered possible, Michael Swaine, an expert on the
Chinese military at the Rand Corp., argues that by occupying
islands and drilling for oil, China has seized ``a negotiating
position'' and may want to avoid further military conflict.

CLINTON WELCOMES '95 WITH OLD SONGS AND FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HILTON HEAD, S.C.  (BC-CLINTON-500ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Life,'' the Southern boy's mother warned
him, ``is like a box of chocolates: You never know what you're
gonna get.''
</P>
<P>
With those thoughts, delivered in a wry, drawling homage to the
fictional Forrest Gump, another Southern boy, Bill Clinton,
welcomed 1995 this weekend, adding in his best self-mocking manner:
``Maybe that's why I never liked chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
Or so said several of the hundreds of guests who joined the
president (who is, in fact, allergic to chocolate) at the annual
Renaissance Weekend retreat here, and heard his off-the-record
reflections at a private New Year's Eve party of singing,
hand-holding, reminiscences and hopes for the future.
</P>
<P>
In a visit of just over 24 hours, Clinton stayed up chatting
with old friends till 2 a.m. Sunday, and was jogging through
winding seaside streets in the pitch dark with others by just after
6:30 a.m. He was on a nearby golf course by 7:45 for 18 good holes
that ended just in time for him to catch the tail end of a noontime
panel discussion called ``Life 101: What I'll Do Differently in
'95,'' though he did not offer his own thoughts there.
</P>
<P>
``He hasn't lost his cool,'' said Liz Carpenter, an ebullient
Texan and former aide in the Johnson White House who was making her
first visit to the four-day talkfest of the prominent and the
precocious that Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have been attending
for a decade. ``He obviously feels very comfortable amid these
people -- and so do I. They're wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
His listeners said Clinton was in fine fettle during his
15-minute after-dinner talk late Saturday night, laughing about all
the unsolicited advice he gets. ``He said, `I've gotten a lot of
great advice lately, like: Don't waffle, compromise,''' one guest
recalled.
</P>
<P>
But others said the president also spoke soberly, and
affectingly, of the honors and burdens of his office, expressing
sadness about the death of the pilot whose fatal crash into the
White House lawn last fall he suggested was the result of the same
fame-seeking motives that prompted a daredevil to make a successful
surprise landing in Red Square in Moscow several years ago.
</P>
<P>
``He said, `It's a great honor to hold this office, but a lot of
things make me sad, and probably not the ones you think,''' another
guest said. ``He seemed to be saying I'm a person, and I'm the
president, and that guy got killed because he landed on what
happened to be my lawn. It was very heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
Still others said Clinton spoke without partisanship of his
hopes for passing tax breaks for education, and of his resolve to
press on with health care change, though he acknowledged that it
would have to be incremental because the public did not trust the
government to do more.
</P>
<P>
``Some of us had speculated that he might take this occasion to
whine,'' said one old acquaintance and one-time booster who has
been sharply critical of his presidency. ``He didn't.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
In a year-end interview published in this week's Newsweek
magazine, Clinton also took issue with the notion that he does not
know what he stands for.
</P>
<P>
``I believe the purpose of government is not to expand
bureaucracy but to expand opportunity,'' he said in the interview
last week. ``I do not believe government is inherently good or
bad.''
</P>
<P>
He cited his successful fight to pass a ban on assault weapons,
and his unsuccessful one to change health insurance laws, and
concluded: ``This idea that there's some battle for my soul is the
biggest bunch of hooey I ever saw. I know who I am. I know what I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
As he almost always does in such settings, Clinton partied this
weekend till the last dog died, joining other celebrants around a
piano at the Hyatt Regency hotel here to sing old favorites like
``Down by the Old Mill Stream.''
</P>
<P>
After a quick midafternoon walk back from the hotel to the
private beachfront home where he and Mrs. Clinton were staying with
their daughter Chelsea, he headed back to Washington Sunday
evening, so Chelsea can return to school this week. Monday morning
Clinton will be on the road again, bound for Little Rock, Ark., for
two more days of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
Even his old friends marveled anew at his stamina.
</P>
<P>
``I've been running with the president for 12 years,'' said Joan
Zoffnass, a doctor from New York who did her best to keep up with
the president's predawn pace on Sunday, and was still grimacing a
few hours later. ``I don't drink, but I feel like I have a
hangover. At least I don't have any patients this morning.''

BEARS DEFEAT VIKINGS IN WILD-CARD GAME, 35-18
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MINNEAPOLIS  (BC-FBN-BEARS-VIKINGS-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In effect, the winner of the Minnesota-Chicago
wild-card game would get the opportunity to have their doors blown
off by either San Francisco or Dallas. But at least the Bears will
get a chance to try because Minnesota decided to be incredibly
inept with so much on the line.
</P>
<P>
With its 35-18 victory on Sunday before 60,347 shellshocked fans
at the Metrodome, Chicago moved on in the National Football
Conference playoffs and will play San Francisco next week in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
For the Vikings, this defeat marked a huge blow to the franchise
for one reason: They hadbrought in quarterback Warren Moon to get
them past the first round of the playoffs -- and he didn't even come
close. The entire team didn't.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota made the very ordinary Bears look like world beaters.
And Viking Coach Dennis Green must be concerned about why his team
played so poorly. His teams have now been eliminated three straight
times in the opening round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to happen this way because Moon was supposed
to be the savior this season. He limped into Sunday's game with a
sprained knee, and the Viking offense was about as creaky as the
brace that supported his left leg.
</P>
<P>
Moon (29 of 52 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions)
wasn't sharp, and it was difficult to tell whether it was because
of the knee, his inaction last week, or both. Whatever the case
both he and his teammates didn't perform well.
</P>
<P>
That's a sharp contrast to the overachieving Bears. Steve Walsh,
a bargain-basement quarterback if there ever was one, looked sharp.
Ahead by 14-9 at halftime, Walsh (15 of 23 for 221 yards,
touchdowns, 1 interception) marched the Bears down field on their
first possession of the second half and increased the lead when the
rookie fullback Raymont Harris scored on a 29-yard run.
</P>
<P>
Later, Walsh hit a wide-open Jeff Graham for a 21-yard touchdown
and a 28-12 lead. The Vikings cut into the lead late in the fourth
quarter when Moon threw to running back Amp Lee for an 11-yard
touchdown. The 2-point conversion was no good as Moon overthrew
everyone by 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
Typical of how the game went for the Vikings, with just over
three minutes left in the game and the team driving, Lee fumbled
the ball after being hit by Maurice Douglass. The ball was picked
up by Kevin Miniefield, a third-string safety, who went 48 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
Coming into this game, Minnesota had a distinct historical
advantage over the Bears. Green was 6-0 against Chicago, including
the sweep of the season series this year. All this week no one
could quite explain why Green's teams have dominated the Bears,
although the Vikings' defense has a lot to do with it.
</P>
<P>
In the six losses, Bear quarterbacks have thrown more
interceptions returned for touchdowns (6) than actual touchdown
passes (5).
</P>
<P>
But those same people were at a similar loss to explain why
Green -- only one of seven head coaches to make the playoffs in each
of his first three seasons -- had not won in the post season.
</P>
<P>
His previous quarterbacks, Rich Gannon and Jim McMahon, had been
considered part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Last year in the first round of the playoffs, the Giants
eliminated the Vikings and knocked McMahon out of the game with a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
The Vikings wanted Moon, who has reached the post-season in each
of his past eight seasons, to get them over the playoff hump.
</P>
<P>
He finished the regular season as the National Football
Conference leader in completions (371) and yards (4,264). But what
really mattered to the Vikings was whether Moon could get them out
of the first round.
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the Vikings got plenty of chances to get to a
big lead on the Bears and help end their post-season slump. But it
was their defense that was shining at this point.
</P>
<P>
Their defense has been among the best in the league and is
ranked first against the run. The defensive line is among the
fiercest in the game, and the unit is one of the hardest-hitting in
the league.
</P>
<P>
Running back Lewis Tillman found that out in the first quarter.
He was smashed by linebacker Ed McDaniel when the Bears tried to
force Tillman up the middle. The ball was recovered by Minnesota's
Henry Thomas.
</P>
<P>
But all the Vikings could get out of it was a 29-yard Fuad
Reveiz field goal. And when Walsh threw the ball off the back of
center Jay Leeuwenburg's head, with the ball landing in the hands
of Anthony Parker, the Vikings didn't take advantage. Minnesota's
drive consisted of an incomplete pass from Moon to Carter, a
holding call on right tackle Chris Hinton and Bears lineman Trace
Armstrong sacking Moon.
</P>
<P>
So instead of a possible 14-0 lead, the Vikings were ahead by
just 3-0 after one quarter. The Minnesota defense had to be beside
itself.
</P>
<P>
Walsh then took the Bears on an impressive 16-play, 80 yard
drive that ended with a Tillman 1-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
After Viking wide receiver Quadry Ismail bobbled a pass thrown
right into his arms that ended up in the hands of linebacker Barry
Minter, Walsh took the Bears on a 4-play, 71-yard drive. It began
with a 52-yard pass to Jeff Graham, and ended with a 9-yard
touchdown pass from Walsh to tight end Keith Jennings on a naked
bootleg.
</P>
<P>
As out of sync as Moon looked and as outplayed the Vikings were
in the first half, Minnesota got back into the game when running
back Lee took a routine catch over the middle and because of a
sweet move turned it into a 38-yard completion. Three plays later,
Carter scored on a 4-yard touchdown catch (the 2-point conversion
attempt failed) to make the score 14-9.
</P>
<P>
But the Vikings could never catch up.

WALL STREETERS BULLISH ON HIGH-SPEED FERRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HIGHLANDS, N.J.  (BC-NY-NJ-FERRY-450ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drinkers stood two deep at a horseshoe-shaped
bar festooned with red and green holiday decorations. Laughter
spilled from brokers swapping graveyard jokes about the subway
bomber. A couple of financial analysts, the kind who probably would
talk shop on their death beds, were huddled in a review of the
day's trading on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The only unusual element was the setting. The bar was on an
82-foot boat zipping across the open sea, heading through the
darkness for the New Jersey coast. The boat was half of the
two-vessel, high-speed ferry fleet that runs daily between Monmouth
County, N.J., and New York City.
</P>
<P>
And if the holiday season put the commuters aboard Express
Navigation's ferries in a festive mood, regulars say spirits run
even higher in the summer when the party moves to the open-air top
deck.
</P>
<P>
``Most people at the end of a workday dread the commute home --
this one you look forward to,'' said Rob Wolf, 25, a broker with
Prestige Planning Corp. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
``It's like hanging out with good friends on a cruise every
night with great scenery and fresh air,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
Aside from an atmosphere that accommodates both socializing and
work, the ferries also rate raves for reliability. When heavy snow
or accidents shut down the roadways and trouble on the tracks
interrupts rail service, the ferries have clear sailing.
</P>
<P>
``It's like you're the only car on a 100-lane highway,'' mused
Gary E. Dunzelman, the skipper of Express I, as the double-hulled
ferry left an East River slip at the foot of Wall Street on
schedule at 4:40 p.m. for the 45-minute run to Highlands.
</P>
<P>
Within a minute, the Express I, with about 200 passengers on
board, was gliding over the smooth surface of Upper New York Bay at
its cruising speed of 30 knots (about 34 miles per hour), its bow
aimed directly at the necklace of lights framing the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Daily ferries have been operating to New York City from points
on the Raritan Bay shore of Monmouth County since 1986, and the
acquisition of Express Navigation in 1994 by Holyman United Group,
an Australian passenger boat concern, has raised expectations of
expanded service in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ferries make three round trips each working day, and Express
Navigation officials say they collect about 900 fares a day in
winter (those who travel both ways are counted twice) and 1,200 in
summer. All told, they said, the ferries carried about a
quarter-million passengers in 1994 in 760 round trips, and service
is expected to expand to 1,000 round trips by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Monmouth County has acquired bay-front property at Belford,
N.J., to build a proper ferry terminal, perhaps as early as 1997,
said Henry Nicholson, the county director of transportation.
</P>
<P>
But financing for the $16.5 million project is not yet certain,
and many Belford-area residents have objected to it as a subsidy
for Wall Street workers who reside in tonier towns like Rumson,
N.J.; Little Silver, N.J., and Shrewsbury, N.J.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said expanded service would greatly enhance all
property values along what is called the county's Bayshore.
</P>
<P>
While Monmouth's north shore is less than 20 miles from the
Battery, it is a 65-mile trip by land, a distance that is made even
longer by crowded highways, toll gates, tunnel bottlenecks and
time-consuming transfers between transit lines.
</P>
<P>
A 1991 survey showed that 14,000 Monmouth residents commuted to
work in New York and about half lived within a 15-minute drive of
the proposed ferry terminal in Belford. ``That's a potential market
of 7,000 ferry riders,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the cost of commuting by ferry has held down the
numbers. A monthly commuter ticket costs $440, or $11 a crossing.
Another drawback is that the last boat for home leaves lower
Manhattan at 6:30 p.m. Missing it means making the trek home by
roundabout surface transportation.
</P>
<P>
Still, regular ferry riders swear by the service.
</P>
<P>
Most work in financial district offices a short walk from the
ferry slip at Pier 11 at Wall and South Streets.
</P>
<P>
``I used to drive to work, but now I figure I get 90 minutes a
day of paperwork done on board the ferry,'' said Stephen Ferretti,
33, an exchange floor worker for Goldman Sachs. ``That saves me one
day's work a week, or about one full week a month. Hey, how much is
your time worth?''
</P>
<P>
A commuter who moved to Highlands to be close to the ferry is
Emily Groff, an underwriter at Reliance National Insurance Co. When
she lived in Point Pleasant, farther down the Jersey coast, she
spent about 40 minutes a day traveling between her home and the
dock.
</P>
<P>
She praised the shipboard socializing, likening the return trip
home to dropping into ``Cheers'' for a couple of beers ($2 a can).
``I work or read on the morning trip, but on the way back I mostly
hang out and chat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Dunzelman, who also doubles as operations manager for
the small ferry line, said service has been suspended only six days
over the last five years. ``Ice is our biggest hazard, and last
winter we were locked in a total of three days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Highland-Manhattan ferries have had one serious accident --
in 1987, when the service was under previous ownership and was
called Direct Lines. Two Direct Lines ferries headed in opposite
directions ran into each other in a pea-soup fog, sending 18
passengers to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Most riders said they believed the ferries were much safer than
driving to work.
</P>
<P>
``The only thing that bothers me is the sound of ice scraping
the hull,'' said Ferretti, whose job requires him to exhibit nerves
of steel at work.
</P>
<P>
``Don't worry about it,'' chimed in Wolf, a shipboard friend.
``There are no icebergs out there.''
</P>
<P>
``Yeah,'' Ferretti said, ``that's what they said about the
Titanic.''

GOOD DESCRIPTION AND GOOD POLICE WORK LEAD TO CAPTURE OF RAPE SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-NYC-RAPE-ARREST-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out to visit a friend on a quiet New Year's morning,
the 33-year-old woman grew uneasy as a scruffy black van drew up
beside her on a deserted South Bronx street Sunday. Suddenly, she
later told the police, the driver -- a 300-pound, 6-foot menacing
presence with a face pockmarked by acne scars -- stepped out, drew a
gun and ordered her to get in.
</P>
<P>
She refused. He bashed her in the face, she said, and dragged
her in.
</P>
<P>
The van had no side-panel windows, she remembered, but it was
only 8:10 a.m., and there was no one around anyway. The man raped
her, the police said, and then threw her, battered and bruised,
back onto the street.
</P>
<P>
The man drove away. But his bulk, his terrifying face and other
details had been burned into the woman's memory.
</P>
<P>
She staggered to a phone and called 911. Two officers from the
41st Precinct -- Lee Stewart, 29, a rookie, and Jose Martinez, 35,
on the force for less than two years -- found her minutes later.
</P>
<P>
``She was on the sidewalk, leaning against a pole,'' Officer
Martinez recalled. ``She was crying, very upset.''
</P>
<P>
They called for an ambulance. And while they waited, the
officers tried to comfort her. They gently asked her questions,
too, and obtained the details they needed.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, she said, had been in his mid-20s, had short
hair, weighed more than 300 pounds and had a pockmarked face. He
wore light blue jeans, a dark blue shirt and a dark sweater. And
there were telling details about his van, a black Chevrolet, with
two citizen band radios and a big stereo speaker that looked as if
it had been homemade.
</P>
<P>
The ambulance took the woman to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
Stewart and Martinez resumed patrol, searching the South Bronx
for a dark van. It was 10:15 a.m., little more than two hours after
the rape, when Stewart saw a dirty, black Chevrolet van six blocks
from the scene of the crime. At the wheel was a corpulent man.
</P>
<P>
``Wow,'' Stewart said. ``I could hardly believe it.''
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he drove past the van so they could get a look at
the driver. ``The guy had a lot of pockmarks on his face,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apparently aware he was under observation, the van's driver
tried to speed away, Martinez said, but was caught by the patrol
car and complied with the officers' order, over a loudspeaker, to
pull over.
</P>
<P>
The officers did not approach the van immediately because the
woman had said the rapist had a gun. Instead, they took down its
license number and radioed for backup assistance.
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Elliot Mercado and Officer Thomas Armstrong of the 41st
Precinct arrived two minutes later and they moved in with drawn
guns.
</P>
<P>
``We approached cautiously from the rear at four different
angles,'' Martinez said. ``The guy was alone in the van, and he was
fidgety and nervous, looking back at us. We told him to throw the
keys out the window, to step out and put his hands against the side
of the car.''
</P>
<P>
A search turned up no gun. But the man's features, clothing,
vehicle and the items the victim had seen inside fit her
description.
</P>
<P>
While Mercado and Armstrong guarded the suspect, Stewart and
Martinez went to the hospital and brought the rape victim back to
have a look at the man.
</P>
<P>
``She identified him as the one who committed the crime,''
Martinez said. The victim was returned to the hospital, but was
released after treatment for trauma and for cuts and bruises of the
face and head, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Eugenio Cruz Jr., 26, was charged with rape,
assault and other crimes. The police said he had been convicted on
a weapons charge last year and was free on bail pending sentencing.
</P>
<P>
``It was really good police work -- excellent police work,'' Sgt.
Frances Haimeck-Mladinich, a police spokeswoman, said. ``They took
a detailed report, they went back out on patrol and they kept their
eyes open. There's always a hope that you might run into the person
you're looking for.''

SUSPECT'S WEAPON ISN'T OFTEN USED IN CRIMES, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NORFOLK, Va.  (BC-ABORTION-WEAPON-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the many puzzles in the case of John C. Salvi
III, the suspect in two killings at abortion clinics, add the
question of why he was arrested carrying a weapon used more often
for squirrel hunting than for shootouts.
</P>
<P>
When police officers surrounded his pickup truck on Saturday
after a clinic here was sprayed with gunfire, Salvi tossed a
.22-caliber rifle out the window.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the rifle is no toy. The authorities said a
.22-caliber weapon was also used on Friday in the slayings of two
receptionists at clinics in Brookline, Mass. And at the clinic
here, several shots shattered a plate glass door, whizzed more than
20 feet across the lobby, then burst through a similar window on
the other side, a few feet from a clutch of demonstrators. No one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have not yet been able to determine if the
weapon they recovered could be linked to either shooting.
</P>
<P>
But gun experts said a .22-caliber weapon is not often used in
crimes, because the ammunition's relatively small width means it
does less damage than the firearms that detectives more often see
on a street, usually .38-caliber or 9-millimeter weapons.
</P>
<P>
The .22-caliber has a light recoil making it easier to shoot.
The gun Salvi surrendered in Norfolk was semiautomatic, meaning he
would have had to squeeze the trigger to fire each round. The rifle
found here was made by Ruger, a German manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk police would not say what model Ruger rifle had been
recovered when Salvi was captured. The company makes both
.22-caliber rifles used for hunting and more powerful .223-caliber
military-style rifle, the Ruger Mini-14.
</P>
<P>
In both cities, witnesses said the man who fired at the clinics
carried his weapon in a black duffle bag. In Brookline, Mass., the
bag was left behind and held receipts from a gun shop in New
Hampshire where, according to federal records, Salvi had purchased
a .22-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
The Virginian-Pilot, the daily newspaper in Norfolk, reported on
Sunday that Salvi had bought a .22-caliber Ruger rifle from a
former employer for $100 in 1992.

At the time, Salvi was working for a building-maintenance
company in Naples, Fla. The company's owner, Mark Rogers, was
quoted as saying that about two years ago, just before Salvi moved
from Florida to New Hampshire, he modified the gun by hacking off
its barrel, cutting down the stock and adding a banana clip, a
device to feed more ammunition into the rifle.
</P>
<P>
``He told me he needed it that way when he went into the woods
to shoot,'' Rogers was quoted as saying.

LEADERSHIP STANDOFF COULD OVERSHADOW ANY LEGISLATIVE AGENDAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SACRAMENTO, Calif.  (BC-ASSEMBLY-SPEAKER-2Takes-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Assembly reconvenes
Wednesday with its leadership still in question -- and the prospect
of a long standoff between Republicans and Democrats that could
overshadow any legislative agendas.
</P>
<P>
The power struggle began Dec. 5, when new lawmakers convened and
failed to elect a speaker -- despite Republican gains in the Nov. 8
election that briefly gave them the Assembly majority for the first
time since 1970.
</P>
<P>
The fight is now about to spill into the regular 1995-96
legislative session, as Democrat Willie Brown Jr. of San Francisco
fights to remain as speaker and Republican Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga seeks to topple him.
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Panorama City, a longtime Brown
lieutenant, said legislators from both parties are exchanging
plenty of phone calls, but said he doesn't believe anyone is making
deals.
</P>
<P>
``I haven't heard of any serious efforts to gain any
commitments,'' Katz said, adding that he believes all 39 Democrats
and independent Paul Horcher of West Covina are still for Brown,
and all 40 Republicans are still for Brulte.
</P>
<P>
Horcher was re-elected as a Republican but then switched his
allegiance to Brown and became an independent -- denying Brulte the
speakership.
</P>
<P>
Brown, the speaker for the past 14 years, has proposed a
bipartisan group of legislators meet to devise a power-sharing
arrangement -- preferably with him as speaker.
</P>
<P>
Brulte has countered that because voters elected a Republican
majority to the Assembly, he must be named speaker -- but promises
to treat Democrats fairly.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday afternoon, Brulte released a letter to Democratic
Assembly members reminding them of Republicans victories Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
``We won 41 seats on Election Day, and we will have 41 seats
again, sooner rather than later. This being the case, there is
tremendous reluctance to negotiate away the Republican majority. I
cannot do that, but I can be fair,'' Brulte wrote.
</P>
<P>
The stakes for both parties are high, including committee
chairmanships and assignments, board and commission appointments,
and control of staff and resources, all of which could have major
influences over legislation in the Assembly for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
And, because there is yet no popular outcry about the stalemate,
it potentially could continue for weeks or even months, said
political scientist Sherry Bebitch Jeffe.
</P>
<P>
``It's certainly important in the Capitol, but it has a very
small audience,'' Jeffe said. ``It won't engage most voters until
it begins to impact them, and that might not happen until budget
time.''
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution requires the Legislature to pass a
balanced budget by June 15, a deadline that is usually missed.
</P>
<P>
``Over time, we may see some kind of power-sharing or compromise
third candidate emerge,'' Jeffe said. ``A lot of the Republicans'
problems are with Willie Brown the person, they just don't trust
him. So if this goes on, we could see them propose someone else.
Until then, many people might not be too upset about the Assembly
not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
``What's really holding us up now is Brulte's refusal to name a
group of Republicans to sit down with us and work it out,'' Katz
said. ``He'd apparently prefer to gamble on costly recall
elections. It's a risky strategy that could tie us up for weeks,
with everyone waiting to see what happens in the recalls.''
</P>
<P>
The Assembly speakership plot so far has been full of twists and
turns.
</P>
<P>
Republicans won a one-vote majority in November and declared
Brown's long speakership over, but lost their advantage Horcher
slammed his fist on his desk and quit the party.
</P>
<P>
Democrats could have won the speakership then by expelling
Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy, R-Arcadia, who had also won a special
election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic chief clerk of the Assembly sided with
Republicans and wouldn't allow the vote, only to be hospitalized
with stress and exhaustion the next day leaving Brown, as the
house's senior member, the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
Republicans reacted to that problem by frantically leaving town.
</P>
<P>
Now, Republicans hope threatened recalls against Horcher and
four moderate Democrats will swing at least one vote back to
Brulte, while Democrats hope to break the tie by disqualifying
Mountjoy, who still hasn't taken the Senate seat he won nearly two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Brown and Brulte have each declared themselves the only suitable
leader, but each has since expressed a commitment to bipartisan
power-sharing. However, the two still appear far from a resolution.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brown said he will preside at Wednesday's session and reverse
the ruling of chief clerk E. Dotson Wilson (who says the law
requires him only to preside on the opening day of session), which
disallowed a vote on the fitness of Mountjoy to serve in the
Assembly. With Mountjoy excluded from that vote, the 39 Democrats
and Horcher could vote 40-39 to oust Mountjoy and elect Brown
speaker.
</P>
<P>
But Brulte remains confident that at least a few Democratic
lawmakers will respect the wishes of the voters who elected a
Republican majority, and allow him to assume his rightful role as
speaker, spokesman Phil Perry said.
</P>
<P>
``Do they really want to force out a duly elected member of the
Legislature for purely political reasons? Is this the precedent
they intend to set? We remain hopeful that a few reasonable
Democrats will refuse to do that,'' Perry said, refusing to name
them.
</P>
<P>
To prove his good intentions, Brulte is offering a
constitutional amendment to reduce the speaker's power and
guarantee the minority party representation on committees and a
fair share of the house budget.
</P>
<P>
``We have the opportunity to force bipartisan cooperation, we
have the opportunity to guarantee the minority party allocation of
resources and real justice, and we have the opportunity to diminish
the power of the speakership, to see to it that some of the abuses
of the past never occur in the future,'' Brulte said last week.
</P>
<P>
``Term limits changes forever the way Sacramento gets to
operate,'' he said. ``The stability of the institution is at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Election day, Brown said he was the only
person qualified to lead the house. Later, he said he planned to
step down at various times during the session if elected speaker.
On a Sacramento radio show last week, he rejected Brulte's idea and
pledged instead to to go along with whatever a bipartisan group of
10 lawmakers decides, even if it means a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
``I think that a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans
should meet,'' Brown said. ``Out of that discussion should come a
new model for house operation, a model reflecting of the change in
the makeup of the house as the result of term limits, as well as a
result of voter participation.''
</P>
<P>
He said such a bipartisan solution is necessary because of the
nearly even split between Democrats and Republicans, and because
the house is now dominated by inexperienced legislators.
</P>
<P>
``I've always been prepared at any time during the course of my
14 years to do what is appropriate and best for the house, period,
and that's my dedication and that's my goal, and I keep insisting
that there shall be such a meeting,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
``Out of that may come either one of the two candidates for the
job being given the responsibility, or somebody different. I'm
prepared to support the work product of that which means it could
exclude Willie Brown as leader.''
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Assembly will have to get down to serious policy
making this year, and there will be no shortage of issues. On the
table will be cuts in the state income tax, school spending, prison
spending, no-fault auto insurance, the Smog Check program,
recycling programs, workers compensation reform, health care,
Orange County's fiscal problems, and services to illegal immigrants
while Proposition 187 is tied up in court.
</P>
<P>
If a speaker is elected this week and committees formed, those
issues can begin to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
``I'm praying that happens,'' Brown said.

PROMISING `CERTAIN AND IMMEDIATE' CHANGE, PATAKI BECOMES N.Y. GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALBANY, N.Y.  (BC-NY-PATAKI-INAUG-573(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling for a new revolution to make government
both smaller and more effective, George Elmer Pataki became the
53rd governor of New York Sunday with an inaugural address that
promised ``sweeping and fundamental change that is certain and
immediate.''
</P>
<P>
In a 38-minute address, long enough to lull 7-year-old Owen
Pataki into dozing on his mother's lap, Pataki repeatedly summoned
the imagery of the American Revolution and suggested that his
election was born of the same discontent with taxation and
bureaucracy that incited the colonials.
</P>
<P>
``The battle which took place on a farm not far from here near
Saratoga was the turning point in that revolution,'' he said,
returning later in the speech to what he called the ``revolutionary
spirit of Saratoga.''
</P>
<P>
``And I would remind those who are disturbed by the people's
current mood of the lesson from that battle -- the lesson that much
good can come from the people's determination to see that
government remains their servant and not their master.''
</P>
<P>
With former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo sitting on the stage to his
left, Pataki said New Yorkers believe their government has become
``too big, too unwieldy, too distant, too arrogant.'' But he also
suggested repeatedly that government was capable of resurrecting
itself into a force for good.
</P>
<P>
``What those in government have done, those in government can
undo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the speech was a recitation of Pataki's campaign themes,
delivered this time for a television audience that had a new reason
to pay attention. He called for cuts in state taxes and spending,
an expansion of the state's workfare program for welfare
recipients, term limits for elected officials, restoration of the
death penalty and abolition of parole for violent felons.
</P>
<P>
Pataki's speech capped a weekend of celebration for New York
Republicans, who have not held the governorship for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Pataki stayed until well past 1 a.m. at a New
Year's Eve party that he threw for friends and aides at an Albany
hotel, dancing sweatily to hits from Motown and the Rolling Stones.
He traveled to his inauguration in a comical convoy down Albany's
State Street, where the only observers on a damp and misty morning
were a few churchgoers and a jogging mob of reporters who pleaded
with the governor to lower the windows of his Lincoln Town Car.
</P>
<P>
After the inauguration at the Knickerbocker Arena, which was
attended by an estimated 13,000 people, Pataki made the rounds at a
sprawling reception in the concourse of the Empire State Plaza,
sampling a piece of a giant sheet cake that bore his likeness in
icing.
</P>
<P>
The party featured salsa bands and barbershop quartets, as well
as Lithuanian meat pies, Nigerian seafood rolls and other ethnic
foods from dozens of countries. The day was topped off by a
$100-per-person, black-tie gala at the Omni Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Although the day was reserved for pomp, Pataki's aides were
preparing for a full workday on Monday. His counsel, Michael C.
Finnegan, said that a senior staff meeting was planned for the
afternoon and that another meeting would be devoted to reviewing
death-penalty legislation.
</P>
<P>
Other personnel appointments are expected later this week, with
Pataki aides saying that State Senator John B. Daly, a Lewiston
Republican, is now the front-runner to become transportation
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the day was historic for Pataki and the Republicans.
But it also was momentous for State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who
was sworn in as the first black New Yorker to be elected to
statewide office.
</P>
<P>
McCall, a Democrat, had been elected by the Legisalature in 1993
to fill the vacancy left by the midterm resignation of Edward V.
Regan. But he did not face a popular election until last fall, when
he defeated Herbert London.
</P>
<P>
``My election,'' McCall, 58, said after the ceremony, ``will be
a signal to young people throughout the state, particularly
African-American young people, a sign of hope for them and a sign
of encouragement. There will be no barriers as a result of race.''
</P>
<P>
Two other statewide officials, both Republicans, also took the
oath of office Sunday. Elizabeth P. McCaughey, 46, a constitutional
scholar who worked for a conservative foundation, was sworn in as
Pataki's lieutenant governor. And Dennis C. Vacco, a 42-year-old
former U.S. attorney from Buffalo, became state attorney general.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a pipe-and-drum brigade escorted Pataki into the arena, he
was greeted by a thunderous cheer that sounded the Republicans'
relief from two decades of frustration.
</P>
<P>
In the stands, one fan threw his hands in the air as if his
favorite team had just scored a touchdown. Supporters on the floor
rattled ``Pataki for President'' signs. As Pataki took his oath,
which was administered by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the State
Court of Appeals, those in the arena could hear the echoes of a
19-gun cannonade being fired outside.
</P>
<P>
Pataki delivered his speech in the breathy cadences that mark
his oratorical style, making points of emphasis by pumping air
rather than volume into his voice. Adopting the Reaganesque tactic
of recognizing heroes in the audience, he stopped his speech at one
point to pay tribute to Jason McEnaney, the State University
student who was shot last month while tackling a gunman who had
taken his class hostage in Albany.
</P>
<P>
The governor began by acknowledging the anger of the electorate
but said he believed the ``anger is a generous and optimistic
anger.'' He called for ``effective but limited government,'' and
repeatedly stressed the theme of personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
``When government accepts responsibility for people, then people
no longer take responsibility for themselves,'' he said.
``Individual responsibility and personal freedom are inevitably
linked.''
</P>
<P>
Pataki's largest ovation came when he reiterated his campaign
pledge to sign the death penalty into law. ``When a society does
not express its own horror at the crime of murder by enforcing the
ultimate sanction against it, innocent lives are put at risk,'' he
said. ``Not out of a sense of vindictiveness, then, but a sense of
justice -- indeed, a sense of compassion for those who otherwise
might become victims of murder -- I will ask the Legislature to pass
and I will sign and enforce the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, who vetoed death-penalty bills 12 times, sat motionless
as the crowd erupted around him. ``It disconcerts me that the
loudest cheer would be for death,'' he said in an interview Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the former governor, who received a standing ovation from
the primarily Republican crowd, also congratulated Pataki heartily
after the address, telling him, ``That wasn't a good speech, that
was a great speech.'' Cuomo said Pataki ``did what he had to do --
he had to say what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he
found inconsistencies in some of Pataki's pledges and was eager to
see Pataki convert from a campaigner into a governor. For instance,
he said, ``if you are going to incarcerate more criminals and
violent criminals for a longer period of time, you're going to
spend money.''
</P>
<P>
Pataki will start to transform his broad promises into more
detailed policies on Wednesday, when he will deliver his State of
the State address, and again on Feb. 1, when he presents his first
budget proposal.

AUTHORITIES SEEK REASON FOR CLINIC ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NORFOLK, Va.  (BC-ABORTION-ATTACK-850ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators said Sunday that they were trying
to figure out why John Salvi III, a New Hampshire man accused of
killing two women at abortion clinics in Massachussetts on Friday,
came to this Tidewater city, which has been a hotbed of
anti-abortion activity.
</P>
<P>
Salvi has been charged with murder and with assault with attempt
to murder in the attacks in Brookline, Mass., in which two
receptionists were shot to death and five other people were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested here on Saturday, shortly after shots were fired
at a Norfolk abortion clinic; no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Police officials in Virginia and Massachusetts, as well as
people on both sides of the abortion issue, said Sunday that Salvi
was not known as a prominent figure of an anti-abortion group,
though New Hampshire authorities said they had found anti-abortion
literature in his home in Hampton Beach.
</P>
<P>
Salvi is being held in the city jail here and has been talking
to the police since his arrest, which came 26 hours after the
killings in Massachusetts. But he has refused to talk to reporters,
and police investigators refused to disclose what he said in five
or six hours of questioning on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said he did not yet have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Salvi, who was hailed Sunday as a hero by some local leaders of
the anti-abortion movement, was described by friends as a moody,
Scripture-quoting man.
</P>
<P>
Salvi's neighbors said he had a fight with his father shortly
before Christmas, apparently because the older man disapproved of
his son's decision to pursue a career as a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
Salvi's parents live in Naples, Fla., and visited him over
Christmas at his home; their whereabouts Sunday could not be
determined.
</P>
<P>
The clinic here, the Hillcrest Clinic, has often been a target
of picketing, protests and demonstrations since it opened in a
block-long three-story building in 1973.
</P>
<P>
An intruder set a fire in the clinic in 1983, and a pipe bomb
exploded near it in 1984. It is not known whether Salvi had visited
the clinic before Saturday, or whether he had received information
or assistance from local abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who will be the Senate majority leader in
the new Congress, Sunday described the attacks on the clinics as
acts of terrorism. He suggested that clinics might need more
federal protection.
</P>
<P>
On the CBS News progam ``Face the Nation,'' Dole said,
``Obviously this is murder, terrorism, call it what you will.''
</P>
<P>
While the government cannot protect every abortion clinic, he
said, ``let's do what we can do to stop the violence.'
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk police said Salvi was captured by a stroke of luck.
An arson investigator, looking into an earlier fire at a bank in
the same building, saw the shooting, chased the gunman's truck and
summoned police officers, who arrested Salvi three blocks from the
Hillcrest Clinic.
</P>
<P>
The police said he had fired more than 20 rounds from a
.22-caliber semiautomatic rifle into the building.
</P>
<P>
Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Norfolk police, said Salvi
tossed the .22-caliber Ruger rifle from the window of his truck
moments before he was arrested. Gun enthusiasts say such weapons
are popular for squirrel hunting and target practice but are not
often used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
Two militant opponents of abortion in the Norfolk area, the Rev.
Donald Spitz, 48, and David Crane, 36, said the violence was
understandable and perhaps even justifiable.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Sunday, Spitz, the director of an organization
called Pro-Life Virginia, said that if Salvi had killed abortion
clinic employees in Brookline ``to defend the lives of unborn
babies, it's justified, it's moral, it was a righteous act.''
</P>
<P>
``It's not right to go kill people,'' said Spitz, who described
himself as a Pentecostal evangelist. ``But when people are involved
in killing babies, then it's justified to save the babies. The
point is to save the babies, not to kill people. Babies deserve to
be defended at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
Eight opponents of abortion showed their support for Salvi with
a rally and prayer vigil in front of the jail Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Spitz and Crane said they had been field directors of Operation
Rescue, an anti-abortion group that has tried to block access to
clinics across the country. Spitz said he was expelled from the
organization last year because it ``holds to the philosophy of
nonviolence in every situation,'' and he could not endorse that
stance.
</P>
<P>
The two men said they had not heard of Salvi before he was named
as a suspect in the shootings in Brookline. Hill said that the
authorities here had no evidence that Salvi had had any dealings
with Spitz or Crane but that the police were investigating to see
if there were connections.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
Crane, the director of a Norfolk anti-abortion group, Citizens
for Justice, and Spitz signed a petition last year declaring that
it was proper to take ``all godly action necessary, including the
use of force, to defend innocent human life, born and unborn.''
</P>
<P>
The FBI expressed interest in the activities of both men in
August, when it began an inquiry into a possible conspiracy to use
force against women's clinics around the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his church Sunday, Crane said the shootings
and bombings at abortion clinics were ``random acts of
individuals.'' But he said they could be explained.
</P>
<P>
``Deadly force is being used against the unborn, so people are
now willing to use that same kind of force against the abortion
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some opponents of abortion condemned the
killings. The Rev. Richard Hardison, pastor at the Tabernacle
Church of Norfolk and a longtime friend of Crane's, said the
protests against abortion should be conducted peacefully. ``At no
point did Christ ever take up arms to prove his point,'' Hardison
said.
</P>
<P>
Judi Brown, president of the American Life League, based in
Stafford, Va., said, ``The death of anyone diminishes each one of
us, whether it be by suction machine or by bullets shot by a man
who was most obviously disturbed.''

<P>
Marino, Montana and Moon.
</P>
<P>
The names lack the hallowed ring of Tinker to Evers to Chance
but the trilogy signifies a sense of generation as three
quarterbacks approach the defining points of their careers. One
career has been truly spectacular, the other two outstanding but
star-crossed.
</P>
<P>
Montana's career has been distinguished by fulfillment; Marino's
and Moon's have been sprinkled with accolades, lavish statistics
and mounds of frustration. Frustration they hoped to end this
season.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday in Miami, Dan Marino outdueled Joe Montana as the
Dolphins' 33-year-old quarterback inched closer to an elusive
second Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game was billed as a battle of legends, but there's
only one legend in all three of these M's, and that's Montana.
</P>
<P>
Marino simply won another battle of statistics, completing 22 of
29 passes for 257 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions.
Montana was 26 of 37 for 314 yards and 2 touchdowns. The game
turned on a Montana blunder, when Miami's J.B. Brown intercepted
his pass near the goal line as Montana was leading the Chiefs on
one of his patented drives.
</P>
<P>
After the loss, Montana, who like Moon is 38, was asked about
retirement. ``Ain't even thinking about that right now,'' said
Montana. ``I didn't think I had to think about it. It's like asking
a fighter after he's lost a championship bout if he'll fight again.
You feel bad, but, yeah, the game's fun. I'm having fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
Montana, with four Super Bowl rings already, entered Saturday's
game solidly enshrined as a legend, voted to the National Football
League's 75th anniversary team with quarterbacks Otto Graham,
Johnny Unitas and Sammy Baugh.
</P>
<P>
Marino and Moon entered their respective games this weekend with
all those accolades but with a gap when it came to winning the big
ones. Marino was blessed with great receivers and cursed with
porous defense. Moon was beset throughout his career with gimmick
offenses that built up passing stats but short-circuited in
critical games.
</P>
<P>
While Montana was out to simply add to a legend created over a
16- year career, all Marino and Moon can hope for is to win enough
games to put themselves in position to capture just one
championship before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's game, a reporter asked the Dolphin quarterback
whether the victory settled the score between Marino and Montana.
In the 1984 season, Marino, a brash, 23-year-old, second-year pro,
met Montana in Super Bowl XIX. Miami was trashed.
</P>
<P>
``This didn't settle a score,'' Marino said. For all the talk
about gun-slinging, all the attention by the news media giving
Marino equal billing with Montana, Marino knows that he has yet to
scale a mountain that Montana has already scaled four times.
</P>
<P>
The difference between Montana and Marino may have best been
encapsulated by a critical game against the Jets last month that
came down to the final play. With time running out, with the ball
near the Jets' goal line, Marino made believe he was going to spike
the ball to stop the clock. Instead, in the split second that the
defense relaxed, Marino fired a touchdown pass to win the game.
</P>
<P>
Ingenious. Legal. But a play that nonetheless leaves a bad taste
in your mouth. That's not like Montana to Dwight Clark to beat
Dallas in a conference championship game; not like Montana to John
Taylor to beat Cincinnati in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
If the phenomenon of Marino is numbers, the miracle of Warren
Moon has been endurance. He entered the NFL in 1984, the season
Marino and Montana met in the Super Bowl. Moon spent his first six
seasons in the Canadian Football League and came to Houston in a
high-priced deal that the Oilers hoped would take the franchise to
new heights. It proved to be a roller coaster instead.
</P>
<P>
By 1985, he was criticized for an inability to read defenses; in
1986, critics were calling Moon ``disappointing;'' in 1987, he won
the passing title and helped Houston make the playoffs for the
first time since 1980. In 1989, the Oilers needed to win one of two
remaining regular-season games to win an undisputed division title.
They lost them both and failed to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Moon was on pace to set passing records when he
dislocated his thumb in the 15th game of the season. The Oilers
were humiliated in a 41-14 first-round playoff loss, A year later,
Houston won its first division title and failed to get past the
second round. In 1992, Houston blew a 32-point lead to Buffalo and
was eliminated once again. Last season, Moon was injured down the
stretch, came back and met Montana head to head in the playoffs.
The Oilers lost.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, with a new team in a new city, with a bum
knee, Moon was revisited by the same frustration. Lots of numbers:
29 of 52 for 292 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions. Lots of dink
passes. No victory. The game was a microcosm of Moon's playoff
career: up and down, alternately cheered and booed. He excited the
crowd with a touchdown pass to Amp Lee with 5:36 left to play to
narrow the Vikings' deficit to 28-18. But then a 4-yard pass to Lee
was fumbled and returned 50 yards for a Chicago touchdown.
</P>
<P>
The numbers that loom are the numbers that frame Moon's playoff
portfolio: 3-6 in 10 seasons with Houston, 0-1 with Minnesota. The
Vikings were first-round losers in each of the past two years. Now
make that three.
</P>
<P>
Moon's playoff frustrations began 10 years ago under a dome in
Houston. They grew deeper on Sunday afternoon under a bubble in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Marino survives, Montana is out. Now Moon is, too, at least for
this season.

BOMBING PLOT SEEN IN NOTES, OFFICIAL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK  (BC-NY-EXPLOSION-635ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notes and drawings found in the home of Edward Leary,
the accused subway firebomber, show that he planned to detonate
bombs with motion-sensing devices and remote controls and to gun
people down with a high-powered rifle as part of a terror campaign
in the subways, a law-enforcement official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two gasoline bombs that have been attributed to Leary were
both meant to explode aboard trains while they were in tunnels,
possibly under the East River, to achieve the maximum carnage and
panic, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Both devices instead exploded in subway stations, and the
official said that one went off sooner than the bomber intended and
the other exploded much later than intended.
</P>
<P>
Leary, who has denied any role in the bombings, was badly burned
in the second incident, on Dec. 21 in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
That bombing injured 45 people, brought subway and vehicular
traffic in the Financial District to a standstill and revived the
sense of vulnerability to terrorist attacks that gripped the city
after the World Trade Center bombing, almost two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the bombings were botched casts serious doubt on
Leary's ability to carry out the more sophisticated attacks that
were described in his notes, the official said. But since Leary is
believed to have carried out two bombings, he said, ``It has to be
taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
In the days after the Dec. 21 bombing, officials said that six
pages of notes found at Leary's home showed that he planned a
campaign of bombings on the subways to extort money, probably from
the Transit Authority or the city.
</P>
<P>
The plans for a remote-controlled, motion-sensing bomb and a
sniper attack were first reported Sunday in New York Newsday.
</P>
<P>
Leary's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, assailed police leaks in the
case Sunday, saying, ``What they're trying to do is prejudice the
public so he can't get a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
Asked Sunday about the drawings and notes reportedly found in
Leary's home in Scotch Plains, N.J., Murphy at first questioned
their existence, but he said later at a news conference that they
were Leary's notes for a science fiction novel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some of the threatening notes attributed to
Leary by the police were actually notes written to him by other
residents of the Brooklyn co-op building where he once lived,
during a dispute two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the report that Leary planned more sophisticated bombings,
Murphy said: ``He's not capable of this stuff. It's 50 miles beyond
him.''
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement official said the notes were crucial to
building a case against Leary.
</P>
<P>
``You can't really get a conviction based just on people's plans
to wreak havoc,'' he said. ``And we can link him to the Dec. 21
device through eyewitness identification, though that alone might
not be enough for a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
But combining the witness accounts, the attacks that were
carried out and the notes found in Leary's home, he said, ``You
have a very strong case.''
</P>
<P>
Leary has been charged with the Dec. 21 bombing aboard a No. 4
train at Fulton Street and is a suspect in a Dec. 15 bombing aboard
a subway train in Harlem that injured two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
A police official said Sunday that 10 witnesses to the Dec. 21
incident recall seeing a man matching Leary's description sitting
on the subway, holding a bag that reeked of gasoline and made
sounds like glasses clinking together.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said that the bomb was contained in a pair of
glass mayonnaise jars.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, officials have surmised from the fact that
Leary was injured that the Dec. 21 bomb went off sooner than the
bomber expected. An official said Sunday that the Dec. 15 device,
which did not ignite completely, went off much later than intended.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bomb may have been planted on the No. 3 train
in Brooklyn, detonating as much as half an hour later at the 145th
Street station in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
In each case, the official said, ``He wanted this thing to go
off in a tunnel,'' possibly under the East River, where escape and
rescue efforts would have been most difficult.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were seriously burned in the Dec. 21 bombing,
and nine of them, including Leary, remain at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
One victim, Renfield Edey, remains in critical but stable
condition. Two other people who were originally in critical
condition, Leary and Brenda Dowdell, have been upgraded to serious
condition.

LONG ISLANDERS SHRUG OFF NEW SMOKING BANS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.  (BC-NY-SMOKEBAN-400ADD-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a New Year's Day of football, beer and
munchies at Jerry Cusack's bar and restaurant here on Route 111,
and even though a tough new smoking ban had gone into effect in the
county, many patrons were smoking as usual.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, Cusack and other restaurateurs do not face
the threat of fines because of smokers until June 1, when the last
of a series of new restrictions are to be phased in by Suffolk
County.
</P>
<P>
Most of his customers, Cusack said, were unaware of the new
regulations, among the toughest in the country and even stricter
than those recently passed by the New York City Council.
</P>
<P>
``I'm not a smoker myself, and I hate smoke,'' Cusack said.
``And in a perfect world no one would smoke. But I'm in a business
that serves both smokers and nonsmokers. And I can't afford to lose
half my customers because of government interference.''
</P>
<P>
Those who support the smoking restrictions say such predictions
are unfounded. Nora Bredes, a Suffolk County legislator who
co-sponsored the ban with Paul J. Tonna, said she was confident
that there would be no decline in business at bars and restaurants
because of the new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
``There hasn't been a drop off in customers at movie theaters
and at airlines where they've banned smoking,'' she said.
``Everyone who breathes air has got to have an interest in seeing
this law go into effect.''
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will require bars and restaurants to ban
smoking by the end of the month or start plans to construct
separate enclosures for those who smoke. Cusack, who said he had
not yet decided which course he would follow, said the average
restaurant would have to spend around $50,000 for such a separate
floor-to-ceiling enclosure.
</P>
<P>
For now, restaurant employees are supposed to tell patrons that
the law has taken effect and that they should not smoke.
</P>
<P>
The fines -- to be paid by restaurant owners and not patrons --
will range from $50 to $250 a day. The law enables the county to
place liens against businesses that refuse to pay.
</P>
<P>
The rules are the latest and strictest measures approved by
Suffolk County, which for two decades has led the nation in
enacting tough antismoking legislation, beginning with a ban on
smoking in supermarkets, then including malls, offices, theaters
and other public places.
</P>
<P>
The new law, signed last June, affects restaurants and bars
where food constitutes at least 40 percent of sales. It also bans
smoking in schools, day-care centers, bowling alleys and other
sports and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cusack, who owns and operates Heffron's bar and restaurant here,
also is co-chairman of the Long Island Hospitality Association,
which represents some 400 bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
``We're still hoping that the law can be changed or modified,''
he said. ``If not, many of us will be going out of business.
Certainly, no one's going to be opening any new restaurants in
Suffolk under these terms.
</P>
<P>
``This law sends out a message loud and clear that Suffolk is
anti-business,'' Cusack added.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bredes defends the restrictions and calls them overdue.
</P>
<P>
``Since tobacco smoke has been proven to be one of the leading
causes of cancer,'' she said, ``it's surprising that we haven't
done something about it sooner.''
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Both she and Tonna said that their efforts to pass the law made
them the target of heavy opposition from the cigarette lobby, led,
they said, by Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
Nassau County is currently reviewing its antismoking laws and is
expected to follow Suffolk's lead. Nassau now enforces state
requirements, which ban smoking in hallways, elevators, bathrooms,
sports arenas, hospitals and all other public places, said Cynthia
Brown, spokeswoman for the Nassau County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
She said that restaurants with 50 or more seats must now limit
space for smokers to no more than 25 percent of their capacity.
However, smoking is permitted in bars and the bar areas of
restaurants. Nassau also observes the state law that bans smoking
in common areas in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
New York City also currently follows state guidelines in
restaurants. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to soon sign
a bill, adopted by the City Council on Dec. 21, that would ban
smoking altogether in restaurants with 35 or more seats. Smoking
would be permitted in bar areas and in enclosed ``smoking
lounges.''
</P>
<P>
In the workplace, the New York City bill would allow smoking
only in separately ventilated rooms and private offices with no
more than three employees. If the bill is signed, the law would go
into effect in late March.
</P>
<P>
Cusack said that his organization planned to continue to fight
the new Suffolk rules and would speak against them on Jan. 24, when
legislators who oppose the regulations plan to hold a hearing on
whether to impose a yearlong moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents want the county to await the results of Federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearings, to be
concluded later this month, on whether to ban smoking in the
workplace. Should restaurant workers be included in the ban,
opponents say, it would make all local laws moot and would make the
building of separate enclosures for smokers unnecessary.

SUSPECT'S WEAPON ISN'T OFTEN USED IN CRIMES, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NORFOLK, Va.  (BC-ABORTION-WEAPON-1STLD-WRITETHRU-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the many puzzles in the case of John C. Salvi
III, the suspect in two killings at abortion clinics, add the
question of why he was arrested carrying a weapon used more often
for squirrel hunting than for shootouts.
</P>
<P>
When police officers surrounded his pickup truck on Saturday
after a clinic here was sprayed with gunfire, Salvi tossed a
.22-caliber rifle out the window.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the rifle is no toy. The authorities said a
.22-caliber weapon was also used on Friday in the slayings of two
receptionists at clinics in Brookline, Mass. And at the clinic
here, several shots shattered a plate glass door, whizzed more than
20 feet across the lobby, then burst through a similar window on
the other side, a few feet from a clutch of demonstrators. No one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have not yet been able to determine if the
weapon they recovered could be linked to either shooting.
</P>
<P>
But gun experts said a .22-caliber weapon is not often used in
crimes, because the ammunition's relatively small width means it
does less damage than the firearms that detectives more often see
on a street, usually .38-caliber or 9-millimeter weapons.
</P>
<P>
The .22-caliber has a light recoil making it easier to shoot.
The gun Salvi surrendered in Norfolk was semiautomatic, meaning he
would have had to squeeze the trigger to fire each round. The rifle
found here was made by Ruger, an American manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The Norfolk police would not say what model Ruger rifle had been
recovered when Salvi was captured. The company makes both
.22-caliber rifles used for hunting and more powerful .223-caliber
military-style rifle, the Ruger Mini-14.
</P>
<P>
In both cities, witnesses said the man who fired at the clinics
carried his weapon in a black duffle bag. In Brookline, Mass., the
bag was left behind and held receipts from a gun shop in New
Hampshire where, according to federal records, Salvi had purchased
a .22-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
The Virginian-Pilot, the daily newspaper in Norfolk, reported on
Sunday that Salvi had bought a .22-caliber Ruger rifle from a
former employer for $100 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Salvi was working for a building-maintenance
company in Naples, Fla. The company's owner, Mark Rogers, was
quoted as saying that about two years ago, just before Salvi moved
from Florida to New Hampshire, he modified the gun by hacking off
its barrel, cutting down the stock and adding a banana clip, a
device to feed more ammunition into the rifle.
</P>
<P>
``He told me he needed it that way when he went into the woods
to shoot,'' Rogers was quoted as saying.

A `NEW DAWN' IN ALBANY, BUT A SEATING CHART REVEALED AN OLD FEUD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALBANY, N.Y.  (BC-NY-INAUG-NOTEBOOK-2TAKES-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-gun salute thundered outside Knickerbocker
Arena and, later, lasers flickered from the podium as a disembodied
voice sputtered, ``Pataki! Pataki! Pataki! Pataki!''
</P>
<P>
Birds and crickets chirped from somewhere, as if to greet what
the printed programs called ``a new dawn.''
</P>
<P>
But for all the pageantry of the first Republican inauguration
here in 24 years, it was the seating arrangement on the dais, more
than anything, that hammered home how much things have changed.
</P>
<P>
Mario Cuomo, who has dominated every stage he sat on since 1982,
was seated quietly to the podium's right, applauding selectively
and fidgeting with his glasses.
</P>
<P>
The radio personality Howard Stern -- whose long hair stuck out
in the crowd and not just because it sucked up so much confetti --
was seated in the third row, behind Chief Judge Judith Kaye and in
front of William Powers, the Republican state committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
Stern is credited with turning out the vote in the last few days
before the election by stumping for George Pataki on the air.
Jackie Mason, the Republican bard, also sat near the podium, though
in a back row.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Marino, the courtly Republican who was ousted last month
after six years as Senate majority leader, took his place behind
the man who wrested him from power, Sen. Joseph Bruno. And New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who won no friends among Republicans by
supporting Cuomo in the election, was seated in the third row, the
same as Stern, though across the podium and a bit farther from the
action.
</P>
<P>
The dais, ringed with 4,000 roses, was a scene of jubilation.
The oratory looked to the future. But some slights were not
forgotten. Just before the ceremony, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato strode
past Giuliani without looking at him. And then, as if to underscore
his continued displeasure with an old friend, he then shook the
hand of Giuliani's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Behind Smoked Windows
</P>
<P>
The celebration began with a frosty procession from the State
Capitol building over slippery streets to the arena.
</P>
<P>
The question: Where was Pataki? The 35 gold-bedecked bagpipers
had marched off, followed by Peekskill and Cortlandt firefighters
(the companies where Pataki's father, Louis, was once a volunteer).
</P>
<P>
Reporters scrambled, slipping on ice as they tried to figure out
which limousine with smoked windows carried the state's 53rd
governor.
</P>
<P>
Finally, halfway to the arena, a window came down and a few
people on the street cheered. As reporters gathered in, practically
crushing each other to hear every word, Pataki said he felt
``tremendous.'' He then explained the rolled-up window. ``We don't
want anybody to get hurt,'' he said, without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Luck Without Lentils
</P>
<P>
Mimicking his idol, the former New York Gov. Theodore Roosevelt,
who used to greet the public on New Year's when he became
president, Pataki will hold a reception for the public inside the
Executive Mansion on Monday. But rather than greet anyone who
stands in line, as Roosevelt did, Pataki's aides came up with a
clever idea: hold a lottery to determine who is invited.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the swearing in, Pataki's daughter Allison, 9,
selected the winning number, 68892, which was printed on the back
of 500 of the programs. Those people, plus a guest, can attend and
shake the governor's hand.
</P>
<P>
Tony Spano, one of the winners and the 28-year-old brother of
Sen. Nicholas Spano, a Republican, said that in his family it's a
tradition to eat lentils at midnight on New Year's Eve. ``But I
didn't, and it's supposed to bring good luck,'' he said. ``It just
tells you that it's a myth, all this eating lentils.''
</P>
<P>
Have a Varenyky
</P>
<P>
The new administration did know how to throw a party. The
underground concourse at the Empire State Plaza was packed with
what organizers said was 10,000 people. There were a dozen musical
groups, from the Uncle Sam Chorus of Troy, N.Y., featuring Uncle
Sam himself singing in harmony, to two guys in dinner jackets
blasting out Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
There were 100,000 pounds of vegetables, 175 cases of cheese, 90
kegs of beer, 42,000 toothpicks and 200 pounds of lobsters.
</P>
<P>
There were also 22 booths of different ethnic foods. The people
at this so-called ``People's Reception'' ate spinach empanadas from
the Argentine booth; varenyky, or potato dumplings, from the
Armenian booth and sauteed buffalo with wild rice from the Native
American booth.
</P>
<P>
Pataki's ethnic origins are Italian, Irish and Hungarian, and
the people who ran the Hungarian booth were especially proud to be
there.
</P>
<P>
Sandor Fiegler, 54, a retired construction worker from Latham,
N.Y. who immigrated from Hungary when he was 16, said that Pataki
is a common name in his home country, where it means ``little creek
or brook.'' He was in Budapest during the election in November and
said many Hungarians went wild when Pataki won.
</P>
<P>
He said people flocked to his booth, where he was serving
goulash thick with paprika, kielbasa and rolled pastries called
kalacs. ``Everybody says, `we've got to try out what he eats,' ''
Fiegler said. ``Probably he's never tasted it anyway.''

The Pataki Express
</P>
<P>
Albin Sabol settled into his seat on Amtrak's Pataki Special
Sunday morning, looked out at the mist shrouding the Hudson and
mused aloud about how a tow-headed boy he used to help with science
projects could grow up to become the governor of New York state.
</P>
<P>
``All I know watching George grow up is that he doesn't have to
be led and he won't be led,'' Sabol said. ``He's got a mind of his
own.''
</P>
<P>
``He was a bright kid and all our kids played together,'' Sabol
added.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Sabol and his wife, Connie, were among about 250 people
who got up at dawn and climbed aboard a special express train to
Albany. There were 21 Lubavitch Hasidim from Crown Heights in
Brooklyn, several Chinese-American Republicans from Flushing,
Queens, a dozen Black Republicans from the city and a foursome of
Bangladeshi businessmen who had supported the governor.
</P>
<P>
At Croton-on-Hudson, a party of 22 friends and aquaintances of
the governor from his home town of Peekskill crowded aboard with
drinks and American flags. They pasted a banner above their seats
that read ``The Pataki Party Train'' and posted a list of the top
10 ways to get to the inauguration. (The top of the list was ``Take
Amtraky to Pataki.'')
</P>
<P>
``I want to be part of it,'' said Gigi Lisella, 39, a housewife
from Peekskill. ``I mean, how many times in your lifetime is the
governor of New York state going to be from your hometown.''

HUNT FOR SUSPECT WAS VAST, BUT LUCK PLAYED CRUCIAL ROLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BOSTON  (BC-ABORTION-MANHUNT-550(2TAKES)-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the frantic first minutes after a man shot his way
through two abortion clinics here, instantly killing one woman,
fatally injuring another and leaving five people wounded and
bleeding, the Brookline, Mass., police took the first steps in an
intensive manhunt that would stretch from U.S. Customs offices on
the Canadian border to a lonely stretch of highway in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
Yet thorough as it was, the net stopped hundreds of miles short
of where the suspect, John C. Salvi III, would later be captured.
While officers from more than a dozen federal, state and local
law-enforcement agencies followed a trail that began with what one
official described as a ``wonderful treasure trove'' of evidence,
the suspect -- identified within hours of the attacks -- eluded every
net and was caught only by chance.
</P>
<P>
The manhunt and its conclusion, as detailed by federal, state
and local officials and eyewitnesses, reveal both strengths and
weaknesses in a system that combined the country's most
sophisticated forensic research with old-fashioned good luck.
</P>
<P>
It began at 10:04 a.m. on Friday, when the 911 line started
ringing and yellow panel lights flashed at the Brookline police
station. The caller was traumatized and afraid. Moments before, the
caller said, a tall man dressed in black had burst into the waiting
room at the Planned Parenthood clinic at 1031 Beacon Street and
started spraying bullets at clinic patients, their family members
and the staff.
</P>
<P>
Howard Brackett, the chief of the Brookline Police Department,
said the officers were immediately sent to the scene. Within
minutes, the first two officers arrived, confirmed the attack and
sent a message over the radio system calling for backup units.
</P>
<P>
Several blocks away, Patrol Capt. Daniel O'Leary heard the news
and sent patrol cars to three other clinics in the area. One patrol
car stopped less than half a mile from the Planned Parenthood site,
at the Repro Associates clinic at 1297 Beacon Street. It was quiet.
It was also calm at Women's Health Services at 822 Boylston Street.
</P>
<P>
Another car headed to the Preterm Health Services clinic about a
mile to the west of the first attack. While it was on its way, the
gunman took out a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle and continued
his murderous spree there. Another call came over the police radio.
But the gunman had vanished by the time the patrol car arrived,
running west along Beacon Street, witnesses later said, then
disappearing from sight.
</P>
<P>
Chief Brackett said the first minutes after the shootings were
chaotic. Victims were calling out for help. Witnesses were hastily
rounded up for details. And areas likely to be important to the
investigation were roped off.
</P>
<P>
As ambulances from the Brewster Ambulance Service started to
arrive and emergency medical technicians began unloading
stretchers, police still were not sure whether the attacks were
over. More officers from federal agencies and the Brookline and
Boston police departments were sent to guard other sites where
abortions were performed, as well as flashpoints like the
headquarters of the Massachusetts chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
While police rushed to secure the other sites, investigators
began to pore over the crowded crime scenes.

<P>
As they pieced together the evidence, police learned that the
gunman had exchanged fire with a security guard at the Preterm
clinic. The security guard, Richard J. Seron, was wounded, but he
unwittingly provided crucial material that would soon identify the
suspect. When he shot at the assailant, the gunman left a duffel
bag behind as he fled.
</P>
<P>
Inside it, a police officer familiar with the investigation
said, were critical pieces of evidence: a .22-caliber handgun, a
receipt from a Salisbury, Mass., gun shop, and four or five clips
of ammunition that had been purchased a day or two before. The bag
also yielded a print.
</P>
<P>
The sales slip provided police with their first important clue,
sending them off to Bob's Tactical Shooting Range and Gunshop in
Salisbury in pursuit of a suspect they then could identify only as
John, the name written across the receipt.
</P>
<P>
An agent with the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and a Brookline police officer immediately
headed for the shop, not daring to call ahead for fear that shop
employees might themselves be accomplices. While they headed north,
on an hour-long drive to Salisbury, a witness reported that a white
compact car that was double parked outside the second clinic might
have been involved in the assault.
</P>
<P>
The information led to a brief period of confusion as police
officials started looking for that car, which Chief Brackett
described as ``one of about 9 million white compacts in the Boston
area.''
</P>
<P>
Information obtained at the gun shop would quickly resolve that
confusion and send the police searching for another vehicle
entirely, a black 1987 Toyota pickup.
</P>
<P>
Chief Brackett said records kept by the Salisbury gun shop soon
connected a resident of Hampton, N.H., with the crime. But the
clerk who had handled the sale, the shop owner's son, was the only
person who could identify the customer. And on the day of the
shootings the clerk was on a bus from Boston to New York City,
heading back to college.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts state police were sent to stop that bus, but
it had already gone across state lines into Rhode Island, shifting
jurisdictions. The Rhode Island police picked up the chase near
Providence. They found the bus, pulled it over and asked for the
shop clerk, Fred Smith, who was taken away for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was nervous but helpful, told the police he recalled
selling bullets to the suspect and helped provide a thorough
description.
</P>
<P>
Shop records were quickly located that gave Salvi's full name
and address. Motor vehicle records provided a blurry photograph and
the fact that the suspect had been issued a parking ticket outside
one of the Brookline clinics on May 14.
</P>
<P>
Investigators went immediately to the motel where Salvi had been
living. But they were too late. A landlady at the Beachside Inn,
where the suspect lived in a furnished one-room rental, told them
he had come and gone. The police later learned that he stopped to
pack a bag and throw out his Chistmas tree.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the police had already started to fan out looking for
Salvi's local connections. They learned that his truck was
registered both in New Hampshire and in Massachusetts. Old records
sent teams of officers off to Lynnfield, Mass., a former residence,
and to the home of an uncle in Ipswich. The uncle said Salvi's
parents had visited for the Christmas holidays but were on their
way home to Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Investigators got the telephone number of a mobile phone that
Salvi's parents had with them as they drove south. That information
was conveyed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which within
minutes placed a tap on the number in case the parents were to try
to reach their son.
</P>
<P>
``We thought that maybe he was heading to a summer home or
something and that they might be calling him not even knowing what
was happening,'' an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
Although the police would not release Salvi's name until early
the next morning, when a warrant was issued for his arrest, hour by
hour investigators gathered more details linking Salvi to the
crime.
</P>
<P>
They copied the image off his New Hampshire driver's license,
duplicated the photographs of several other men with similar
features and then provided witnesses with a photographic line-up of
possible suspects. Several of them identified Salvi as the gunman.
The questioning continued until well past dawn.
</P>
<P>
Suspecting that Salvi may have slipped north, to cross the
border into Canada, or headed south by plane to Florida to rejoin
his family, law-enforcement officers were stationed at customs
offices in Maine and Logan Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before noon on Saturday, while the investigation
continued in Hampton, a man stepped out of his black pickup truck
in Norfolk, Va., about 450 miles south. Outside the Hillcrest
Clinic, long a site of abortion protests, he fired, spraying the
three-story brick building with more than 20 rounds and shattering
the glass back door.
</P>
<P>
But this time, Ken Harlan, a Norfolk Fire Department
investigator who was searching the site as a result of a suspicious
fire on Christmas at an automated teller machine in the building,
watched the suspect coolly fire.
</P>
<P>
Harlan, who was in plainclothes but had a department-issued
9-millimeter Smith and Wesson in his holster, chose not to shoot,
fearing that pedestrians might be hurt. Instead, when the suspect
climbed into a black truck and drove away, Harlan followed and
called for police reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
Three blocks away, several Norfolk police cars converged on the
truck. Salvi threw his rifle from the window in a sign of
surrender, then gave himself up.
</P>
<P>
At the Norfolk police station Sunday morning, Officer Larry Hill
said it took the Norfolk department almost 30 minutes to confirm
that the man in their custody was the subject of the manhunt.
